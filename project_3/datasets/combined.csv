2,"I’m pretty new to posting so I hope I do this right. 

I’ve been on keto since the middle of Jan and I’m down about 40lbs as of this morning. Starting weight was 281. 
I’ve lost 4 inches off of my hips and 4 off my chest and a couple off my waist. 
I’m actually started to get a little frustrated and I feel like I’m not getting results like I should. I don’t see a difference in the mirror. The pics show one but I guess it’ll take me longer to see it. And I’m also having the worst time 💩 lol
I appreciate this community I’ve learned so much already. I’m going to buy some sugar free candy I think and see if that helps in the bathroom 😅

Posting for posterity and accountability’s sake. 

It creeps back and before you know it, all the new clothes that fit after losing weight don’t fit anymore. 

This was taken 5/13/20. I don’t know how much I weigh but I’m guessing it’s around 165-180. I am very short, only 4’11 so even that number is huge on me. I’m upset that I let myself gain back to what I started when I did keto the first time. Keto was very successful for me, taking me down to around 135 at my lightest.

Today I have eaten two eggs scrambled with sautéed spinach and some two good vanilla yogurt mixed with a tablespoon of peanut butter. Pretty heavy on the calories but I plan on a lighter lunch and dinner. 

Here’s to a successful Keto Round 2!",1

I am so excited with what I’ve accomplished and now I have a future to look forward too. 

I hope my hard work can encourage and inspire others.

Edit: oh my god! My first ever gold. Thank you so much. That means so much to me 💖

Edit2: 5 awards including a gold and platinum!! You guys are going to make me cry at work. The outpouring of support and caring is tremendous and has touched my heart. Like many of us I have low self esteem (and while my fiancé does his best to lift me up) this has been an eye opener. After work I plan on reading every single comment and reply to all questions.

6,"Hi there. 26F and have been on keto for just over a year. Its just been getting better and better for me on this diet and now I have found a wonderfood! Sauerkraut!
Sometime when my meal is very fatty I can get a bit of acid reflux but I found that sauerkraut makes it sooo easy to digest. No discomfort at all! In fact, I felt a bit of a buzz after dinner as if I'd been a tad drunk and feeling quite euphoric. I had heard that these fermented foods are good for the gut and now I can feel it! It is an acquired flavour but I advise to give it a go! 

That's all, KCKO!",1
7,"I’m curious to know if any other women notice their appetite flairs up during their menstrual cycle while on keto. This last month I managed to finally get myself into deep ketosis. I just started my period a few days ago and I’ve never been hungrier in my life. Normally I don’t eat more than 12 or 1300 calories but for the last 3 day’s I’ve been eating 1800 to 2000, today so far has been my heaviest flow and I’ve already exceeded 2000 calories. Previous periods I haven’t been this hungry so I’m thinking it’s in correlation to how deep into ketosis I’ve been. Any other women experience this?",1
8,"Time for the before and after photos.  February 2020  at 270 lbs love about this community. Every day I can log in and see someone, male, female Larger than life or just barely overweight. I see these people struggle, complain, and succeed Its something that is absolutely amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

So I am 27 years old Male and I finally decided after seeing a picture of me and my wife at a Wedding that enough was enough I was disgusted with how I looked in the pictures.

[https://puu.sh/FJWHl/4cd87f7aee.png](https://puu.sh/FJWHl/4cd87f7aee.png)

At this point for me I was heaviest I have ever been, 270 lbs at exactly 6 ft. I finally decided it was enough. I had heard about keto many many times before but never actually took the plunge. But I finally decided to on Febuary 28th I took my first before picture and started. The FAQ honestly saved me because my first two weeks of keto were a joke I had no keto flu symptoms (besides the wonderful explosive toilet time). The thing that completely blew me away was the ability to suppress my hunger. I have been someone who would constantly eat. As I was eating I was thinking about the next meal I was going to eat. Keto saved me from all that! One month in I actually found myself going 16 hours without eating just because I just wasn't hungry!

And even on the days where I was struggling with Sugar struggling with cravings I made a post and the moderator and community helped talk me down over the edge of breaking keto. They really saved me and that is the most wonderful thing I could ever ask for.

Its now May 13th which also happens to be my birthday WHOO. I have decided to break Keto today just because I want to celebrate with some Ice cream Cake yum, and drink etc. I know theres carb free alternatives but frankly I think a single cheat is okay.  So for everyone out there, who is struggling, having cravings, just know all of us here have had those feelings. I support you, never stop posting never stop praising, be happy, be wonderful, be better. Thank you so much for the support and introducing me to my future way of life as I am going to be doing keto as my lifestyle forever.

11,"I tried keto for about a month last year. I lost a lot of weight, but I also broke out. Like, A LOT. Mainly on my cheeks. I had pretty clear skin most of my life, but when I started keto I had acne for MONTHS, even after I stopped it. 

What could be the reason? Could it be due to lots of cheese consumption? I also used to have a LOT of stevia. Could it be due to that? 

I’m planning to start my ketogenic diet again next week and I’m just looking for ways to prevent breaking out.

So, I’m back on the Keto Bus after 2 years and all the way back up to my SW when I first tried it. I successfully got down to 212, then major life changes threw me off track. Now that I’m quarantined, have limited workout equipment, and surrounded by junk food, this was my solution to eating hundreds of grams of carbs daily. 

What are some pointers y’all have for maintaining your motivation? I can’t help but get into “instant gratification” mode and I wanted to know how y’all have kept yourselves going? I tend to beat myself up and then quit.

During quarantine(i’m still wfh) I decided to recommit.  So far so good, I’m back at it with a mix of 16:8, Keto, and exercise 4-5 days a week.  My concern is last time I only did Keto, I track everything I eat in Carb Manager and have my fitbit linked.  So it’s showing my average daily calorie intake as being negative 300 calories a day.  My understanding is the key to weight loss is creating a calorie deficit, but this seems extreme.  I don’t want to hurt my body or my metabolism.  Am I in jeopardy of doing that?

17,"Hello all, I just started doing the keto diet and it's difficult, to say the least. I've been sticking to it for about a week now, and I feel like I have better concentration, but the cravings for carbs are still pretty strong. I've also heard good things about consuming [apple cider vinegar](https://christiansreviews.com/are-apple-cider-vinegar-pills-effective/), and how it may curb cravings, but I am wondering if anybody else is combining these two techniques? Any benefits to this.",1
18,"I've been on keto for a few weeks now and this week I've started calorie counting too. I've lost 3kgs so far and I have another 3-4kg to go. However, I'm thinking about switching from keto to a more traditional low carb diet i.e. instead of aiming for 20 carbs or less a day, I'll aim for less than 50. The main reason for the switch is that I'm finding it too difficult to get enough fibre in my diet while restricting myself to just 20 grams of carbs a day. The additional carbs will mostly be more vegetables and maybe a little bit of fruit. 

I fully understand that weight loss is about calories in vs calories out more than anything else, and my only goal at this moment is to burn fat. Therefore, my question is the following. 

Assuming I keep my daily calories at the same deficit, and continue eating enough protein to maintain muscle, would my fat loss be the same rate following a more traditional low carb diet compared to what it would be with a strict keto diet?",1
19,"I want to be healthy on a keto diet, but the only meat I like is red meat. I'd prefer to eat steak and cheeseburgers (bunless) everyday, but everything I read says that you shouldn't eat red meat more than 3 times per week. I keep trying to like other meats, but they make me gag to the point where I have to throw them away. I like fried chicken fingers or nuggets, but since that isn't healthy, I'm not going to incorporate that. I'm sort of at a loss here. I'm attempting to get myself to enjoy eggs, but it's not going great. I like cheese, but it takes a ton of cheese to get enough protein in a day.

Please advise.

20,"It's officially been a month since I started keto and I definitely see the results in my body. I haven't stepped on the scale yet and I am tempted to wait till next month to do so but I don't want to do that out of fear. Anywho, I was curious to see how often people doing keto weigh themselves and why?",1
21,"This has literally been the easiest diet I've ever done. I've lost 10 lbs in just 6 days! Most of it is probably water weight, but it's still a huge difference! 

On my first couple of days, I had eggs, cheese, bacon and Italian sausagefor breakfast. For dinner I had either steak or creamy chicken. Apart from dessert, I feel like I'm not even restricting myself at all. I never really cared for rice, bread, or pasta; they're all just fillers anyway and provide no flavour. 

All my carb cravings went away after a few days!

So what struggles did you guys have? I gave myself extra leeway with the bad fats at first, so I don't feel discouraged. I'm gonna start having healthier fats now. Also, my appetite is decreasing day by day. All I had yesterday was breakfast and I still feel full today. 

I feel like this is too easy. Why aren't more people doing keto? Do I need a reality check? If something is too good to be true, it usually is. Am I just in honeymoon phase?",1

I'm re-starting Keto today. Last time I tried it, it was effective in losing weight, but I had to drop out because I was getting too constipated as a side effect. And that was painful when I had to go to the toilet.

Did any of you have the same side effect? If so, what tips &amp; tricks did you use to try to solve it, so you could stay on keto diet?

My plan this time, in addition to green salads, is to try to eat at least three fruits per day.",1

Not sure if this is normal or not. Recently restarted keto and have been having almost non existent bowl movements. I don’t feel constipated but I’m using the bathroom VERY little. I do eat quite a bit of fiber though. Has anyone else experience very little bowl movements? 

Thanks!",1
55,I’ll be honest I’m not the least bit worried about keto flu. There’s no way it can be any worse than the way I’ve felt the past years being over weight.

50LBS DOWN!!!

Just getting started though, my next big milestone will be 75lbs down and then 100, and so on so forth to probably 150lbs. 

I only worked out for a week so far, this has been strictly diet and under 20g net carbs a day. I’ve had 3 slip ups, 1 of which I went to 40g net carbs one day and I thought I was screwed... but I kept at it and didn’t didn’t let the screw up discourage me and it ended up not having really any effect. I stayed in ketosis thank god!! 

I’ve always been a huge snacker and I know people say this all the time, but I legit mean this so seriously... if I can do it, anyone can do it! 

I was always that guy that would eat 2 family size bags of chips each night, maybe add in a package of Oreos, and whatever delicious looking dessert I could find at the grocery store...

It was hard at first when I couldn’t snack when that’s all I had been doing for as long as I can remember, but with some will power, I was able to overcome the cravings. 

If you’re just starting out! Keep going! Don’t get discouraged and hop off if you screw up, shit happens! 

And if you’re just starting out and not seeing results like me, don’t get discouraged as everyone loses at their own pace, I just happen to have a lot to lose. SW: 461.8lbs CW: 411.8LBS

I'm combining keto with the One meal a day time restrictive eating.

I'll mostly be eating fish,boiled chicken, kale, spinach, broccoli and green beans.

Last time i attempted this i was eating alot of nuts and nut butters but i didn't feel very well on that weeklong attempt. I think i may have been dancing in and out of ketosis by not counting my carbs and eating too many nuts.

59,"I applied for Life Insurance with the confidence that my health has turned around after Keto. I lost weight, feeling better than ever. However in the extensive assessment the insurance company has done, they have deemed me too high risk due to elevated total cholesterol, HDL and LDL. (Gave me an outrageous premium) I need to mention, all my other values are \*perfect\*. No risk of diabetes/liver/kidney disease, etc, etc. Height-weight checks out, non-smoker, nothing genetic in the family. BUT they can't look past elevated cholesterol.   
Mind you, I tried to work this out with them. They requested a letter from my physician, which he provided (he is an amazing keto advocate). He explained in his letter how I am not at risk for Cardiovascular disease, how elevated cholesterol is expected and in this case doesn't mean anything. How my large fluffy particles are increased but small particles (which are the ones that matter) are well below acceptable limits.   
The insurance company doesn't care. They want my blood work to look like someone who is on a High-Carb diet.  
So beware - insurance companies don't care about the big picture - you need to fit a specific mold to prove you are ""healthy"".",1

I've had a look online and read lots of threads and posts but I'm still not getting the grips of things yet, presume it comes with time. I have been hitting the 20g each day but im still finding myself hungry/wanting more after meals.

For breakfast I've been having mainly eggs and bacon. Usually 3 eggs which are 3 net carbs. 4 eggs are also 3 net carbs so surely makes sense to have the 4 and fill you up more than just the 3? Bacon is in the same boat approx 2 net carbs for 4 rashers but also 5/6 is 2 net? Am I missing something?

I go back to work soon and start early in the morning with no facility to cook, and I'm at a loss as to what I can have/prepare?

Is there anything I can snack on? I know chicken is free/very low and other meats fall into this as well. Cheese also appears to be low and I have been told olives are a good snack but these all add to the carbs for the day.

Dinner has been pretty much meat and veg, Brussels sprouts/broccoli/cauliflower. 

I am allergic to both eggplant and zucchini so these are out of the question.

Then life got into the way and now I’m back at around 170 but I’m determined to get to my goal weight which is 135. My only question now is what’s your most favorite meal that’s quick and easy? I’d love to try it out!!,1
65,"So here’s a little bit about me. I went on this keto journey a few years ago and lost over forty pounds. At the time I was trying to work on a substance abuse disorder and while I was doing it I decided I would work on my physical health. I eventually fell off the wagon and my diet went with it (I put too much mental energy into keto to keep up with it while living in addict addiction). In March 2019 I moved away from home to a sober living house to get clean without taking any maintenance drugs. I worked on myself for a long time and even started to get my bipolar/GAD treated with meds and counseling. Everything was going great but my weight. It was a constant struggle and was/is a big obstacle with my mental well being and sobriety. 


Well, fast forward to now and I’ve been off work for several weeks and when they called me back in my work shirt no longer fit. Yeah, ouch. I gave away all the food in my cabinet, got a food scale, downloaded a tracking app and started doing keto and IF again. One big thing I’ve done different this time though is avoid the scale. I made a resolution not even to check it for a month and things have been a lot easier. When I gave the scale my attention I would obsess about the numbers which would lead me to a plethora of unhealthy behaviors. I would push myself into fasts that I wasn’t ready for/comfortable with, I would go into unhealthy deficits frequently, obsess over how I was eating and frequently beat myself up. I’m using some of the skills I learned from Alcoholics Anonymous and learning to trust the process. If I eat only in my window, weigh and track my foods, stay in a healthy deficit and show some patience/kindness to myself I WILL lose weight. I can look in the mirror and see how my clothes fit if I want to make sure that it’s working. The number is important, but I’ve found that many of us have an unhealthy obsession with the scale and it often causes us to fail. All of us want to be thin yesterday and that number is a constant reminder that we aren’t. I lost 40 pounds in under 3 months doing this once before, but it was something I couldn’t keep up and because of that I gained it all back. I think my advice as someone who has struggled with more than his weight is to be patient with yourself. If that involves putting the scale away please do that.",1

I’m not really looking to lose so much weight on this diet it’s more for body composition but this has made me realise that I could well have been addicted to carbs. I’ve quit other drugs and experienced the same. 

Initially I thought it meant it was probably allowable for me to have a good cheat meal? But now I’ve realised it’s instead an opportunity to strengthen my resolve, I’ve only been strict keto for 2 weeks. That’s how it’s had to be with other addictions to keep me on the straight and narrow. Love this sub though!",1

70,"I have PCOS and have been following the Keto lifestyle for 3 years and 3 months now. I had initially weighed 482 lbs, and after two years was able to get myself down to 256 lbs. I stayed the same weight for a whole year and then I increased my exercise because my gyno told me that I had no muscle mass and my organs were starting to droop. The more in increase my exercise, the more weight I gain. Is it true that muscle weighs more than fat? I thought that was a fallacy. I am the smallest I have ever been on the diet, but now a year later with increased exercise I weigh 283 lbs- I gained weight with less calories and carbs, and more exercise. I try to stay under 1900 calories and 25 carbs. I am guilty of not calculating exactly or doing macros. I just count calories and carbs and try to stay within my limits- macros are too much for me and stress me out. I also started taking Alpha Lipoic Acid and Ashwagandha to help supplement metabolism , insulin resistance, and cortisol spikes. I just don't understand any of it and seeing a rise in numbers on the scale makes me feel like a failure.",1

This is an update on my post from around a month ago. Currently 42lb down, 10lb since my last post.
Weight loss has slowed slightly over the last month however I am still very happy with the progress. 

I'm mainly posting this to keep myself accountable, however if I can help someone keep motivated, then that would be great as I know things are tough for those of us locked down at the moment.

I’m still not being crazy strict on carbs, mainly just keeping away from obvious sources and more or less trying to keep it to 30g per day. Not measuring any macros. 
Doing at least 30mins of intense cardio a day and another 30/45mins of walking most days too.",1

I've gotten into keto several times and always fail bc of the temptations in my house. With hubby doing it with me as a partner, we're both closer to making it! &lt;3",1
73,"Hi everyone, I’m a 25 year old female and I’ve been on the keto diet for a little over two months. I’ve read that this is a side effect that goes away, but it seems to be getting worse. I have to pee so often (and sometimes multiple times in a row when I haven’t even had any beverages since the last time) and it gets worse at night. I know at first your body is adjusting and releasing more liquids and electrolytes and using up the glycogen stores in the body, but does that really last this long? Not sure if it’s becoming more frequent for me because I’m fat adapted and releasing more ketones, or if something else is wrong. I plan on calling my doc tomorrow but curious if anyone has any ideas. Thanks!",1
74,"Hi guys,

I hope you are all doing well!

To cut a long story short, I started keto a month and a half ago. The scale I ordered has not arrived yet, but I can definitely say I lost weight, from my pants falling down if I don't wear a belt.

The diet in itself has been fairly easy so far, I do not really miss carbs (except for fruit). My issue are with the drinks, it usually is 1 cup of coffee + 2.5 to 3 litres (85 to 100 ounces) of water a day, and I am getting a bit sick of the lack of variety.

The idea would not be to replace water of course, just an occasional ""treat"", without getting kicked out of ketosis.

Do you have some other options, that you use yourselves?

Have a great day!",1
75,"I was doing so well on keto, I lost 26 pounds and was feeling damn good about myself. It started with the panic buying of everybody around me, I didn’t panic shop but felt the need to stock up on some pantry basics because everybody else was. Well big surprise, pantry staples are pretty carb heavy. That turned into cheat days which turned into straight binging and emotional eating and I’m tired of feeling like garbage. I went grocery shopping today and I’m starting fresh tomorrow! No more alcohol, no more junk, counting carbs again. Miraculously I’ve only gained six pounds back but I would like to keep it that way. Also, my knees have been aching so bad the last few weeks. Funny how much you notice that kind of stuff once you get your ducks in a row.

I was diagnosed with narcolepsy when I was a teen and my normal sleep schedule was either 12-15 hours uninterrupted sleep or 8-10 hours with a nap or two during the day. This diet has made me feel like I have control over my body again! For the past week I have only slept ~7 hours a night and I haven’t felt the need to take naps during the day!",1

As for the little things, I had noticed that my belt is no longer able to fasten; its a mechanics belt, velcro so the belt doesn’t scratch as I lean over fenders and the like. I had noticed that I have a bit more room in my uniform shirts. Today, it is a downpour as I type this. I put on my raincoat, and it wasn’t snug. I was able to zip it up without struggling, and pull it away from my body, verifying how much room I had in it. I have also noticed that, while my appetite still feels somewhat ravenous after my fast, what it takes to make me full is considerably less than what it feels like it would take to satisfy that hunger, and it’s amazing.

I know CICO is part of keto. I know limiting carbs/sugars is huge for keto. I know IF is also part of keto, but to be honest, I haven’t even counted calories once since I started.

I still have another 116 lbs to get to my current goal weight, and that goal weight may change to a lower number in the future, but for now, having shed about 1/3 of my weight loss goal feels like a huge milestone for me.

138,"Hello guys

After few weeks I am here again with my progress report.

Life is getting better, more people notice about my weight loss and are very curious about it.

Recently I started to crave sweets little more but I still resist.

I have started Keto in the middle of january with my weight being 116kg. After 4 months I lost 14kg.

I know that some people here are losing weight much faster but I am content. No rush, just slow and consistent losing of fat.

During march/april my progress was pretty slowed because of the quarantine and not able to move around that much.

This result is based purely on change of eating habits, but this week I also started with gym (we have gym in the office) - just running but hey... its a start

What sometimes still surprises me is that losing weight is often like roadblocks... for some time you have very similar weight, and suddenly after a week/ week and a half, boom, 1-1,5 kg down.

Anyway, this is chart of my progress.

I am not really tracking macros anymore - I just (hopefully) know what to eat or not.

139,"After years and years of destroying my body I am making the change to a new healthy me.  I already lost the 110 lbs/50 kg. (thank you keto!) so now I am focused on unfucking all the damage I caused.

So I am OMAD and keto.  If I tell most people either of these things they lose their fucking minds.  I also…don’t eat vegetables that much.  At this point most people have a nuclear meltdown.  I do find it funny that when I used to eat fast food everyday no one had an issue but *now* they are really hyper concerned with my health.  Yes, I am ok, I feel fantastic even.  LOL

Anyways, let’s talk veggies.  I am not a doctor or dietician, I am a guy with internet access.  I eat a small (about 150 gram) avocado a day with a spoon of salsa and 2 cloves of garlic.  Then I eat like ½ cup of sauerkraut a couple times a week and maybe a cup of broccoli once a week.  Then, I am not sure why I even bought the stuff, but I have this wheatgrass powder that I just drink with water once a day.

I don’t feel like I am under nourished from not eating more veggies but does anyone have a reason why I should have more?",1

Left is June 2019, Right is May 2020. I started back on Keto in January, but I am doing a slightly more relaxed version this time. I'm staying under 40 net carbs instead of 20, but that is still way less than what I typically ate before. Low carb tortillas are a lifesaver. As time goes on, I will get closer to 20 net carbs a day.

I am averaging about 10 lbs a month, so that's good. Sometimes I can go up to two weeks and just hover around the same weight, then wake up one morning and be 3 to 4 pounds lighter.

Anyway, this is what about 50 lbs loss looks like on me. Thanks for looking/reading.

141,"Hi r/keto.  It's been a while since I posted or commented, but I still see your posts and celebrate your successes almost every day.

I'm writing for accountability for myself.  The TL;DR is that I lost 57 pounds *twice* using keto (before and after having my daughter).  For the last year, I have not been losing, but I have told myself that I was in ""maintenance mode"" and that even if it took a while to lose the last 15-20 pounds, doing maintenance for practice was valuable.  I looked at the scale this morning and my trends over the last year and realized that I have not been maintaining. I have gained 10-15 pounds over the last year.  Enough is enough.  I am NOT going back to where I was again.  I will NOT re-lose all that weight again.  I start again in earnest today.

The last time I got back on the keto train, I spent two years ""trying to do keto again"" after giving birth, and one day it just clicked.  I'm going to make today be that day again for me.  I was going to write a longer backstory, but I actually think that sums it up.  Backstory doesn't matter.  What matters is moving forward from today.",1

However, I have a massive sweet tooth and am struggling to not eat sweets. With in the first month I tried making a cheese cake but all it tasted like was cream cheese :(

Then I used another recipe  for a insta-brownie in the microwave but all it tastes like is the chocolate powder and eggs.

I typically get some rebels Ice Cream and will eat a container in one sitting (I know, way to many calories). I will also eat some strawberries and heavy cream when they are in season. 

However, I have such a hard time saying no to sweets. I have always had this habit since I was a kid. My dad and I usually wouldn't bring any sweets in the house for that reason.

Now I've been pretty good with no sweets other than my dark chocolate and ice cream. But since Covid started, I have gotten off track. There are always snacks donated to us in the break-room, some of the doctors have been bring pizza and other sweets. I know its my fault for caving, but I really just want to get back on track.

144,"To preface, [this](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199212313272701) is an older study from 1992 but due to the nature of it, I do imagine the conclusions drawn would hold true today. It is peer-reviewed and was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The study shows that people significantly underestimate their caloric intake (by as much as almost 50%) and overestimate their caloric expenditure through exercise. 

This is likely no surprise to most of you and re-examining daily intake is often the very first suggestion made on this subreddit.

So, if you're being patient, think you are consuming the right amount and still really struggling to lose, tracking extremely closely (no eye-balling or guessing) for at least a short period of time to get a better grasp of how much you are really eating, can make a huge difference!

Just for you folks that like to nerd out!",1

148,"It's probably been posted before, but just in case you haven't saved that one post about it. here it is! Feel Free to remove if this breaks any guidelines :)

-1 Cup Crunchy Peanut Butter, Smooth is okay but doesn't always get you the cookie type of texture. Make sure it's a high quality peanut butter. I personally use Sun Pat Crunchy or Pip n'Nut Cruncy Maple peanut butters
-1Cup of sweetener of choice, personally i use stevia but any powdered sweetener will do. Xylotol, Stevia, Monkfruit, hell even powdered saccharins work
- 1-2 eggs. preferably medium eggs but you'll have to add them based on the current texture of the ""dough""
- 1 Cup Almond Flour/Ground almonds. Any flour substitute works honestly, i just use ground almonds for mine. Fun fact: whey protein also works here too 

1) Preheat your oven to Gas Mark 4 (350°F or 177°C.) Mix peanut butter and sweetener together until the peanut butter breaks up and you get a shaggy dough like consistency, kinda like a pie crust pastry dough but slightly more moist. add the Ground Almonds or your flour substitute of choice and continue to mix until fully incorporated.

2) mix in one beaten egg and continue to mix. The mixture at this point should be quite glossy and slightly sticky, like a slightly too wet cookie dough. If not then add your second egg and mix until fully incorporated. 

3) At this point you can feel free to add any other ingredients based on how strict your diet is and what flavours you like! Note: If you use Cocoa Powder, use only the smallest amount you can, otherwise your cookies will be crumbly and awful. I personally like to add a small amount of chocolate chips- preferably dark chocolate. If you do decide to use dark chocolate, add a little bit more sweetener.

4) Using an ice cream scoop, scoop out individual balls onto your baking tray- remember to grease the tray or use baking parchment so they don't stick. Using a fork, score the top of each cookie and press down to flatten it into a cookie shape. Bake in the oven for 15 minutes until kwispy and then leave to cool.

I’m doing IF with keto - I tend to just eat at dinner time, and I like to take my time, so I usually have a 1.5-2 hour eating window (but I’m not strict with the timing of it).

Basically, my question (finally!) is - will having food containing xylitol and/or erythritol every evening make it harder to lose weight/slow down weight loss? I’ve seen ‘If It Fits Your Macros’ and it does, but I’m not sure if having the sweeteners themselves so often will have adverse affect on my weight loss.

I’ve always loved desserts and have had a massive sweet tooth my whole life. I have a keto brownie, two cinnamon ‘doughnut holes’, and about 20 keto gummy bears for dessert - all made by myself, so I know exactly what’s in them etc.

I enjoy having it all, but I don’t necessarily NEED it... but if it won’t affect my weight loss I’ll continue having it as it is something I look forward to after dinner :)

TL;DR: will having xylitol/erythritol every evening affect how much weight I lose?

So I've been heavy all of my life, and keto seems to be the only thing that has ever worked for me. So far I've lost 45 lbs, and I really haven't had any adverse health effects other than a slightly elevated heart rate and a dry mouth. I also had a lot of constipation, which has been somewhat relieved by taking whole psyllium husk and trying to eat at least 2 cups of spinach a day.

I'm more concerned about the fact that I can't eat more than 1200 calories a day, and I often have to force myself to eat, sometimes to the point of nausea. To some extent I'm really happy that I'm no longer overeating, but I'm worried that such a high calorie deficit is really unhealthy for me, especially considering my size. Should I be concerned? Regardless, what can I do to ensure that I'm getting enough nutrients?

SW: 115kg
CW: 96kg
GW: 75 kg

Starting from the beginning, the first time around was in summer last year and I stopped keto because of wanting ice cream. Stopped at 100 kg.

Flash forward, I had the COVID-19 virus and had to do sports to recover. In doing so, I felt some kind of renewed spirit to try doing keto again.
Right now I am 1 month in, lost almost 20 kg. Daily rides on my home trainer (1h , 30km) are my way of burning my calories. I know the first fat you lose is visceral fat. That's where I think I experienced my first real NSV.

So I've been reading thoroughly on the benefits of keto / carnivore diet, mostly for the mental health benefits. I've been iffy about doing the diet because of a) huge predisposition of high cholesterol in the family and a personal history of it and b) my hiatal hernia.

In my last appointment with my gastroenterologist, he gave me a long list of foods that I cannot eat. First thing on the list? Fats and red meat. My specified diet is strictly low-fat and low-acidic to control my reflux. I usually get symptoms such as: feeling as if something is stuck in your throat, coughing, having trouble breathing when lying down, etc. Avoiding certain foods helps, but fat is definitely a trigger. This really saddens me because the more I read the more I think a keto diet could help me for my mental illness.

My concerns are  potential calcium overload (not that I'm predisposed/susceptible, as far as I know). And whether the nutrients already dissolved into the stock, therefore no additional value in eating the marrow and bones?",1

Does this mean this bread is effectively 0g of net carbs, or am I missing something?

Edit: So outside of the US/Canada net carbs seem to already be calculated, so the bread was indeed too good to be true.",1
239,"As a result of keto and fasting, I go 20-24 hrs every day between meals. When I eventually eat, I can only stomach 1000-1300 calories. That sounds like a major calorie deficit, but Im not even trying. Just not that hungry. 

Also, Ive been eating the same exact things, more or less, for the last 3 months. Im fine with It actually. This patterned routine just makes life so much simpler. Another reason is that my food is totally bland, so Im less inclined to scarf down too much and overeat.

Question is: Should I just go with it?  I've heard your metabolism slows down if you do severe calorie deficits like that. Im not going to force feed myself if I don't feel like eating more. I can only tolerate so much fat and protein. In fact, I actually wouldn’t mind fasting beyond 24 hrs. Im just concerned that the major deficit will backfire, and I’ll end up uncontrollably hungry at some point. Its been known to happen.",1

244,"Hello - so I’ve decided after a failed attempt that I’d try the Keto diet properly. Recently, I attempted a VLCD on a weight loss meal replacement program. You would replace 3 meals a day with either a shake, bar or soup. This would eventually get you into ketosis. Anyway I felt awful and gave up after 4 days. As soon as I ate some bread I felt better, my constant headache went (or maybe actually eating solid food helped).

I’ve been following this thread for a while and see the benefits people are getting from this, but I’d like some advice on how to get started and what food should you stock up on? Definitely need advice on how to limit the headaches, nausea etc. Although this might have just been the VLCD program I was doing.

247,"5’9” male, on keto since the new year (5 months). Went from 210 to 170 on heavy calorie deficit averaging 950 cal a day to date with heavy vitamin regime. First 3 months was sub 800 calories, but I’ve been increasing recently to ~1,500 and further expanding my diet variety within strict keto requirements (thanks to some awesome stuff from r/ketorecipes !). Exercise has been steadily and lightly increasing, very light stuff between cardio and anaerobic, as the months go and as my work permits.

My energy levels have just tanked recently. I’ve waited a week and it’s consistently lower. Almost like light keto flu levels. To be absolutely clear, I’ve been super ridiculously disciplined on diet. I may have had maximum 30 carbs in a day and that would have been on a 5 mile run day. I still rarely and only lightly even mess with the sugar alcohols and monk fruit stuff or anything that may come close to throwing me off ketosis. I use a keto mojo every other day and get an average 1.5 mmol/L on ketones and 70 mg/dL glucose. I mix the timing of when I test too, from in the morning before breakfast to a range of times after a meal just to make sure I’m always in range.

Any thoughts? I had tons of energy and clarity for the months while eating 800 or less calories a day on a strict keto diet, but it’s faded really quickly even with more food. Help!

Not as bad as xylitol, tho. Anyone with similar experience?

256,"I started Sunday of last week after a whole month and a half of working out due to being furloughed. Before starting I was on a 2 year long, very relaxed calorie counting diet in which I went from 250 to 180! It's very slow but the weight stayed off. After a lot of deliberating with my husband because I have been stuck at 180 now for the last 6 months, I started keto!

Thomas DeLauer on youtube is a wonderful resource I found for starting out, but of course since I am very confident, I was convinced my 26 year old self wouldn't get the keto flu...and low behold. The third day in I felt like I was going to die and I was very afraid; of course those harsh symptoms went away but now I am dealing with an elevated heart rate? My resting heart rate before this (according to my fitbit) was 57 at it lowest, and since then it has gone up to 66! 

I have also had a lot of restless nights now but I'm also sure that shark week coming is playing into that. I've been trying to work off the restlessness by going for a morning run which is kicking my butt, but I am confident this is all for the best.

Just hit a year. Also is my cake day. Bathe me in sweet karma my fellow former fatties

People seem to post what they did on these so here it goes:

Diet: [Dr. Westerman’s diet. Just followed the instructions](https://lipedemasummit.lipedemaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/No-Sugar-No-Starch-Diet-Clinic-Handout-134067.pdf)

Exercise:  by October, I had lost the majority of the weight by just dieting. Was ~ 195 lbs. joined a HIIT gym. Went 3 times a week in the beginning, then 4-5 times after a month when i wasnt getting so sore. 

My advice is that when I personally started this, it seemed very overwhelming. The avalanche of health science, lingo, and just general information was overload for me and very discouraging.  Rather than try to digest it all and become a nutrition scientist/personal trainer, I just found people who knew what they were doing already and followed their instructions. You can do it.",1

378,"Hi all. I’m in a predicament. I’d done keto on and off for several years with great physical and mental results. I was also carnivore for over a year with fantastic results. I have taken Lexapro for the past ten years, and the combination of keto or ZC was never a problem.... until after 16 months of meat heavy keto, I started getting seriously depressed. It was as if the Lexapro suddenly stopped working anymore and I was having withdrawals and serious depression. 

I’ve tried over and over and over to go back to low carb, keto or carnivore, playing with all my macros, and the same thing happens. The SSRI suddenly stops being absorbed (presumably), and I have withdrawal symptoms and serious depression. I don’t think it’s the keto flu.

Has anyone experienced their SSRI or anti-depressant medication suddenly not absorbing anymore on keto?? Do others wean off their psychiatric meds before or while starting keto?? 

I’m SO bummed about this. I’ve gained so much weight and all of the benefits of my keto lifestyle are gone. This was NEVER a problem before in my 30s, but now (41F, mom of 2 children) I’m suddenly in this terrible predicament.

So I(36F) am a week into my new found keto lifestyle, and I’m finding myself getting a bit confused about macros, and what I need to eat of what in order to loose the goddamn baby weight (currently breastfeeding my 9 month old). I have been really disciplined this week, but I am seeing no results. 

My friend told me that if I do too many proteins they’ll be metabolised as sugar? Maybe that’s my problem. Just finding it hard eating this kind of diet, if I’m not allowed to go ‘all in’ with meat. 

So I guess my question would be - what tool is available for me to fill in my information and get a breakdown of what macros I personally should be dealing with on the daily? 

In advance, thank you all

Addit &gt; I had a good read through the links and I must first apologise for not doing that initially. You guys are super patient, thanks! 

I am 172cm tall and weigh about 72kgs, but I’ve noticed some pretty extreme fluctuations. Within days I can go from 70-74. Probably some water and hormones, accentuated by me breastfeeding still. Never below 70 though. I do light/moderate weights/squats with weights and walk around 4-5k’s a day (with the 10kg baby in a body carries and two large dogs). I’ve always weighed around 65 without even trying, so I’m finding those ~5kgs incredibly stubborn. Also my fat distribution is also much more around back, stomach and hips after this (2nd) baby.

382,"Hello everyone, JCorby17 here! Hope you are all staying safe and doing well on your journey. How was your Mother’s Day, do anything fun? To all the people who get “summer break” soon, just a little bit more, you got this! But anyways, now for the good stuff.

Weight Update: Ladies and Gentlemen, I did it! I hit 275 Pounds (From 277.2 Pounds) on my 3 month “Ketoversery” (2/11/2020)! I am exactly 100 Pounds (see what I did in the title? It would of made more sense if I was from England lol) away from my ultimate goal before I decide what to do next, making my total wight loss in 3 months: 44 Pounds! I can not believe how much Iost in this short amount of time! **My previous Macros are 1900 calories, 140 Fat and Protien, and 20 Net Carbs, so I might change them this time.** And as an award for myself, I’m going to try even harder and become more “strict Keto” (mentally, i’m strict keto because I measure my food exactly and know specific sugars and stuff that I can/cannot eat. Physically however, i can eat less quest bars to “boost my Protien” or start to make foods that is not just eggs + meat + cheese), along with maybe a small sweet treat of course (recommendations are appreciated here lol). I will also start to take exercise much more seriously and do it much more often once finals are over next week (more on that in the Life Update part), and take better care to replenish electrolytes and and stuff in general (sorry Surfaholic for not doing it yet, finals suck). Overall, in this area, everything is great! 

Life Update: Welp, time for the not so good stuff. Finals are here and I’m basically screwed on 1 of them unless a miracle happens due to mainly me being lazy and not taking it seriously at the beginning. This is my fault, but the pandemic is a big factor in it as well, just mentally making people not as motivated to do work (or that’s what I see in me, my sister, and my friends. Might not be the case for others). And, I am still being more rude and sassy to my family, when all they have been is mainly supportive (still don’t fully, but they mostly do, except for my sister Sam) for me. Honestly, i think I need help. After this pandemic is over and things are “normal”, I’m going to get some kind of help so i can learn to become a better person, like not letting things get to me and stuff. If there is any people or resources you recommend, that would be highly appreciated. Other than that, I noticed that I am starting to get hungrier in the morning than before. I think that’s because i have been eating earlier for the past couple of days (still keep a 8/16 or 6/18 Fast easily though), so I think I want to always end my day at 7-8, which might complicate things with the family, but that’s okay. And i think that’s about it.

Thank you all so much for this. It has been a wild ride for the first 3 months of my journey, and its now just truly getting started. If any of you are struggling out there, in any situation, get some freaking help because people are here for you and love you and will help you become the best you can be! I may still be learning on this and in life itself, but I am not going to let others or this stupid pandemic stop me from bettering myself! So, thank you everyone, for your stories and stuff that fuel the fire in my stomach to never give up! Keep calm, Keto on, and stay safe (and determined)!",1

512,"Hello everyone.

After losing over 100lbs and improving all aspects of my life, I considered myself a beacon for those trying to achieve the same kind of weight loss. I tried to spread positivity and love to this community.

Well, I’m in need of some of that right now. After a trip to the US last July, I fell completely off the wagon and back into old habits, almost instantaneously. I gained back 50lbs, and I honestly hate myself right now. It’s been a bitter spiral, and now with quarantine I know I’m on my way to a heart attack. 

I’m still very experienced with keto and know exactly what my meal plan looks like, but I’m an isolationist and have no one around me for support (which also makes me feel like what’s the point) . The few colleagues I work with just make me feel worse by calling me “flip flop” because I keep trying and failing.

513,"Hi everyone!! Last year I started a weight loss journey when I began having stomach pain issues. I was pushing my heaviest weight, totally ignoring the scale and not paying attention to my diet. There was a lot of stress but eventually it was overcome and I realized how little I had cared for myself.

I always had success with low carb diets and had done keto before, so that was my first course of action. Everything was going fine for several months, and I lost a bunch of weight... but was still having stomach issues. Eventually it got the point where I was doing pretty extreme keto but experiencing intense nausea/vomiting/stomach pains most mornings (January 2020). My doctor still doesn’t have an exact diagnosis for me and I’m still occasionally experiencing pain, but his guess is that it’s dyspepsia. My research found that high-fat diets can aggravate dyspepsia (which would explain why my symptoms were so bad when I was doing keto the hardest). 

However, I’ve had such great success losing weight consistently with keto. I haven’t followed it in a couple months and have watched the weight come back on, which is disheartening. I’m struggling to keep the weight loss going on a standard diet as well, and I’ve also been treating myself more often with food because it is comforting to eat tasty things during quarantine.

So my question to this community is - has anyone discovered high-fat diets are not conducive to their health? When you discovered that, did you stop keto altogether or modify your diet? Any tips or suggestions would be super helpful. I will consult with my gastroenterologist as well, but I’m also looking to read about other people’s experience with health issues and high fat diets.",1

I’m just past the 1st week. This did not happen my first time doing Keto (the wrong way lol). I am 26F, SW:213 lbs CW: 208 lbs GW: 150 lbs. I am 5 ft 7 in.

518,"I am about to move in with my Father, who has recently started on Keto (he's done it before and had some success but regained when he went back to a high carb diet). I will do most of the cooking and I'm working on finding/developing recipes that we will both like and that will be okay with my low carb but not keto eating style. He hates chicken and salmon and at this point if I cook them he will refuse to eat them.

I'm looking for suggestions for frozen meals that he could microwave that are keto, don't have chicken, and aren't too spicy (too much spice upsets his stomach). Also if they're available at Kroger that would be great, but I can also go to Trader Joe's or whole foods if I need to. I've been looking online but I'm wondering if you more experienced keto folks might have any suggestions. Or if you have suggestions for recipes that would be very easy for me to prep and freeze, and then microwave well so that he can make something when I'm at work or not around. He's very limited in his ability to stand and walk and can't stand and cook a meal for himself, but he can microwave something.

I know I'm putting a lot of conditions on this, but I'm really trying to find things that will keep him on keto and make it easy on him, because losing weight would really help his mobility and quality of life. 

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.",1

526,"I've done some searching around r/keto about shark week and what to expect, and I haven't necessarily found the answer to my question, so I thought I'd ask here. I've definitely noticed an increased appetite but, interestingly, haven't experienced any carb cravings. (I'm actually craving steak and bacon! Pre-keto, I would have devoured an entire birthday cake and six pints of ice cream while PMS-ing if I would have allowed myself!)

Anyway, I'm due to begin shark week tomorrow, and I noticed last night that my blood glucose was much higher than it had been after other keto meals I've been eating (I had 4g of carbs from cauliflower last night with some steak, and I stick to &lt;20g carbs per day; I honestly have been eating about 80% carnivore). Before bed last night, my BG was inexplicably 121. This morning, it was 97. I know these numbers aren't shockingly high, but I had been testing consistently between 70-105 last week, and had even seen some morning glucose levels in the 60s (second question: is this too low? I didn't feel any hypo symptoms...)

I practice IF, and so I was waiting for my eating window to begin today to break my fast. I've been unusually hungry this morning, so I tested my BG and noticed it was 131, despite having been fasting for 14 hours. I gave in and had some bacon and eggs, which somehow dropped my BG to 105.

I'm puzzled at what's going on, and so I was wondering whether other people who menstruate experience something similar with rising BG levels despite not increasing carbs, and even while fasting. Will this settle the longer I stay on keto? Is this just an issue of increased cortisol increasing glucose, perhaps exacerbated by the fasting?",1

528,"Keto works! Sticking with it along with IF has not been difficult, thanks to quarantine. I started off with a goal of fitting into my clothes from a year ago when I was 225 lbs- the plan was to do keto for 3 weeks so I can look a bit better for an event. I started keto on Feb 23rd, and 2 days before the 3-week mark, Michigan announced the stay-at-home order, which came as a blessing in disguise, and I decided to continue keto. Biggest challenge for me before was alcohol and the late night parties at business school. With those gone, I could finally focus on the one thing that mattered- weight loss. I posted here a month ago, and promised pics when I hit my initial goal- so here you go:  [https://imgur.com/gallery/uTFc8ej](https://imgur.com/gallery/uTFc8ej) 

I have to admit that I cheated a couple of times, but I calculated my cheat meals. I have been doing OMAD and 2MAD (in a 4-hr window) simultaneously, so my cheat meals always happened on OMAD days. I never cheated with sugar though, all 3 cheat meals were just me eating a bowl of white rice (40-60g carbs) with an Indian curry (&lt;10g net carbs). I could hop back on keto (or at least saw that my weight stopped stalling) within 2-3 days after the cheat day. I didn't count my macros (except for carbs) because I was on IF and knew I wasn't over eating or exceeding my daily calorific limit. I have a detailed weight log with all necessary data in a spreadsheet, which I promise to share in my next post when I hit my new goal of 180 lbs. My resting HR has gone down from 74 to 57 bpm today, and I am almost never tired. I regularly jog (more brisk walking plus jogging) and do in-home exercises to supplement my diet as well. 

I am now down from an XL to L; I need a new belt because my old one doesn't have holes that fit me anymore; I need new pants and shorts; and new suits for interviews in the Fall- and absolutely love it! Discovered Rebel ice cream a couple of weeks ago, and that has helped me a ton to suppress my cravings- highly recommend! Keto on, folks- this is the way!

530,"I did keto for 4 months when I was at my largest in college (331 to 279 in just 4 months!) and fell off while just being a little more mindful of CICO. That was in 2016. At some point last year I got down to 250 and typically weigh between 250 and 260.

The first few weeks of this quarantine found me buying all of the comfort food I could gorge on, and before I knew it I was back up to almost 270. Then I developed my master plan:

(1) Eat keto for one week
(2) Start Couch to 5k in week 2
(3) Complete C25K the week of my birthday this summer
(4) Enjoy birthday pizza
(5) KCKO

I have made it to step 2! And almost 8 pounds lighter! Very excited for what is ahead of me in the next 9 weeks.

Did I eat a pound of grilled chicken tossed in buffalo sauce and bleu cheese 4 times last week? Yes. Ashamed? Uh no - look at my scale!

But today I weighed in at 319 down from 344. I had a lot of misconceptions about keto but this sub has been great with recipes and success stories and just informative overall. Thank you guys. 

 It’s helped me to be more active(walking 7miles/week), I’m relying less on MMJ for mental health, and the reduced appetite is nice. I couldn’t stick to OMAD or IF before. With keto, I basically do it just due to reduced eating. Reduced appetite also means less calories so killing a lot of birds with one stone. 

And as much as I hate to admit it, being able to go get a Braums Cheeseburger w/No Bun for lunch and it doesn’t ruin a diet is a good diet for me.

533,"I am sure you guys know about allulose at this point. 

Allulose is a carbohydrate that is chemically sugar but functionally HYPOglycemic due to its chemical structure that doesn't allow our enzymes to digest it. Its' most excreted and doesn't get fermented as well by bacteria either, preventing bloating. 

So far, there is no evidence that allulose causes significant illness to consumers. 

Allulose is great for sweetening because it tastes like sugar, has no bloating effect for many people, FUNCTIONS like sugar in syrup and caramel, and just versatile in general. This is great for making moist cakes, ice cream, sweetened decorative edible like ganache/buttercream, pretty much anything that needs moisture. 

However, allulose has a few major drawbacks.

- More hygroscopic than sugar

- more humectant 

- lacking crystalization 

If you want to make CRISPY thing like shortbread, pie crust, crispy chocolate chip cookies, danish butter cookies etc, you will find it very very difficult to control the end products' texture because allulose retains water much more powerfully. When I first made danish butter cookies and faux-pas oreo cookies, they were soggy as hell and was borderline edible. The way to get around this was to clarify your butter to reduce moisture and add less egg...but even then, it's not enough to get the crispiness you want. It also makes your cookies rise less. 

If you want to make meringue cookies or Macarons, then just forget about using allulose and go for superfine xylitol or erythritol. Allulose-meringue and macaron is just impossible because moisture is a death sentence to these two. The exception is pavlova, a meringue-based dessert that uses allulose which works because allulose's strong humectancy creates super soft inside that is usually attributed to cornstarch in regular pavlova. Here is a recipe that actually [worked](https://www.ruled.me/christmas-wreath-meringue/)",1

695,"I was keto for a couple years.  I would intermittently come off around holidays, on vacation or around a birthday.  I was doing it for long term health benefits, so intermittently coming off wasn't causing me any problems with weight loss goals or anything similar.    

Long story short, we recently moved.  In the chaos of all of that, I came off.  I had every intention of getting back on....and then COVID-19 started shutting down everything and creating food supply issues.  As a result, I haven't made it back on.  During Keto, I eat tons of salad.  Going to the store once every few weeks, it is just tough having fresh stuff around.  I figured it would be short lived so I didn't think much of it.  Now that it seems like we are going to be stuck with ""new normal"" for an extended period of time, I have to figure out my plan.

My question to you all is how are you managing keto during this coronavirus madness?  What are you eating, how often are you going to stores for fresh food, what foods can't you find now and what have you picked up instead?  For instance, I used to eat mac nuts for snacks.  I bought them at Costco and it was by far the best price that I could find.  The new costco (since we moved) doesn't have them and I can't find a good source for them.

I'm confused on the fat burning process though, and could use clarification as I didn't see it in the FAQ. 

The FAQ recommends:
1. Eating less fat than previously recommended to that the body needs to feed on body fat vs consumed fat. 
2. No more than 10-20% calorie deficiency

I understand ketosis can use body fat as a fuel source which eliminates hunger cravings as it's a more steady source of energy. 

However, isn't the fat loss still coming from simply a calorie in calorie out model?

If you eat 50% of your maintenance calorie goals in protien and veggies, and 35% in fat, you are deficient in 15% calories in which your body burns body fat, correct?

The benefit of ketosis being you may not feel as hungry?",1

700,"I've been doing Keto since February. The good news is my wife is my partner in doing this with me.
She was near 385 pounds and is now down below 350. I was around 245 and should be below 200 by the end of this week.
I'm feeling great about our weight loss.
What I'm not feeling great about is constantly being hungry. 
I wake up hungry. I go to bed hungry. The portions on what I eat are so small I'm hungry after I eat.
I think, a lot of it, is I can't find anything Keto that I love.
I was never a big vegetable person. 
I liked Pizza and Pastas.
The pastas I've found taste nothing like what it's replacing.
Pizza is another beast entirely. 
I've seen so many recipes for pizza with cauliflower crust and a way to make that crust crunchy. 
Then I look at the servings. 2 pieces. 
That is not a meal to me. It's a snack.
Now before you think portion control was my issue before, I kept around 2000 calories a day but I usually had a yogurt for breakfast and nothing else until dinner-which I would enjoy.
I can't seem to find any way on Keto I can do that and that was how I would ever feel full.
The lapse last Thursday was for a pizza. I had 6 pieces and that ""fullness"" was the best I felt in months.
I slept better than ever and luckily, it didn't impact my weight loss and I stayed in Ketosis.
I know others have to have gone through this. 
I have the will power-i did this for 90 days until I couldn't take it anymore. 
I guess what I'm asking is it always going to be like this?
My wife isn't having this issue. There are some things she misses but she doesn't have the constant higher feeling I do and gets filled up with the Keto portions. She never ate like I did anyway.
So, I guess I'm asking the community if I should expect this all the time and if there are any Keto foods that I can eat until I'm full.
Is it ok to go off the lifestyle every 90 days or so to get something I like and actually eat until I'm not hungry?",1

I'm planning on giving keto another go around, but I have tended to be fairly carb heavy in the past, but recently love eating vegetables and juicing (I've actually been trying to go completely plant-based but my partner is a meatatarian, who needs this diet more than I do). He's going for more weight loss and I'm hoping for more of dramatic BF% cut. 

Thinking to go really low carb &lt;20g, as last time I was lingering around the 25-50g carb area and noticed little to no effect, other than the hardcore carb withdrawals. I'm hoping to possible cycle keto depending on how well it goes. 

Currently on a high fat (120g), medium carb (200g), medium protein (130g) diet which is very sustainable with absolutely no junk food, hopefully going to transition into keto easier this time around because the massive sugar withdrawals won't be so bad. 

I also do primarily strength/resistance training, obviously toning that down is going to be necessary. 

TLDR; Anyone got any good suggestions for vegetable preparations that worked for them? I'm really not that creative, the higher the fiber the better too.",1

707,"Hi everyone,

After years of thinking whether or not if keto was right for me, I've decided to give it a try since were in quarantine and the beloved gyms are closed.

I tend to get caught up in the minutia which usually leads to me not following through, so for the first time I'm asking for help.

While I understand that counting calories is not necessary, I would like to know what I'm consuming so that after I reach my goal I can be flexible with what and how I eat. I used to count macros when I was actively in the gym and as I try to get my old (or better) body back, I would like to get back in the gym and I believe at this time knowing how I've been reacting to my macros will be important.

I used the macro calculator in the FAQ and with my info (CW: 284, Male, H: 6'1"") here are my results:2549 Calories148g Protein32g Carbs203g Fat

I am okay with the proetin and carbs (I will just try to keep carbs under 20-25G), however the FAQ understandably says ""  Your body can't get all of its energy from stored body fat though, so be sure to consume at least 30g-50g of fat per day. ""

So with this in mind, lets say I decided I would take in 50g of fat, with the above mentioned 148g Protein and 32g carbs, my total calories would be 1,170.

My question is, does 1,170 calories seem healthy?

&amp;#x200B;

For reference:- My activity level is sedentary (quarantine) with the exception of a 15-20 minute walk. I work from home with the exception of a appointments throughout the week.

\- I am also observing Ramadan (no eating or drinking from dawn to dusk), so I usually eat a small meal in the morning and a larger meal in the night after sundown. so, 2mad.

Thanks for the help everyone! I'll start off with a 20% deficit and go from there.",1

710,"I myself have done keto + intermittent fasting (20:4 and occasionally 22:2) for close to a year and I've dropped over 48 pounds (22 kilograms) so far. It's relatively easy for me to incorporate this lifestyle into my life because I work from home.

Following my success with keto and intermittent fasting, a good friend of mine has become interested in trying it out too. He is 40 years old, has diabetes, is married, has two young children, is studying and in addition he is very busy working in health care.  

Unfortunately, so far he is not sure how he could give keto + IF a try because of his hectic schedule. He told me for example that he currently thinks he might not be able to go about his hectic schedule without breakfast because he needs that energy for his very long days. In addition, many days he doesn't even have any time to cook, and on those days he lets his wife make all the food choices.

His wife has been having worsening health problems over the years, and I am convinced that many of these health problems are related to her preference to eat food that mostly consists of carbohydrates, and that she is reluctant to acknowledge that this is actually the source of these problems and/or that she needs to try eating differently to get healthier.

I am very concerned for my friend and his wife, and I hope that I would be able to provide them with some good practical solutions they could both implement into their hectic schedule, so that eventually they would too gradually become more accepting of trying Keto + IF.

What in your opinion is the best Keto + IF plan for such a busy person? have you managed to get any friends or family members, with similar hectic lives, to give Keto + IF a try? if so, did it end up being a good experience for them?",1

1 serving perfect keto collagen

1 serving 365 organic unsweetened vanilla almond milk

4 pasture raised eggs

1 PURE Boost  clean energy drink mix

2-3 servings of Wright brand smoked bacon

\----

LUNCH/SNACK 3pm-5pm

Lilys 92% 1 serving 30g

People's Choice beef jerky 1 serving 28g

\----

Dinner 7pm-8pm

2 servings Sams club organic 85/15 grass fed beef

(Sam's club says on the website 100% organic grass fed and finished) I hope it's true.

1 serving 365 shaved brussel sprouts 88g

1 serving Off the block Sargento swiss cheese 28g

1 Zevia root beer

I do use seasonings in my meals like,

pink salt, everything but bagel, Frontier mexican fiesta seasoning, mustard, franks red hot sauce

Nothing has sugar, canola oil, sucrose, or other garbage (to my knowledge) 

Supplements I take: 1PURE Boost  clean energy drink mix, 1 TRUE Lemon energy (mix with water about 1 gallon maybe less), Garden of life mens once a day multivitamin, NOW C-1000, NOW Vitamin D-3 5000 IU

I am open to any suggestions on if I should keep the course or change anything up. Again this is just a sample from today, I may have to hold out on the brussel sprouts since that dinner meal is a staple that I do tend to repeat because I love it and its very quick and simple to prepare.

I’m stoked for the results I’ve had, but losing weight didn’t fix my self esteem. I feel like I was more confident as a big woman than I am now (being older, 2 babies, and being fat did some damage on my stomach). I wish I was prepared for the saggy skin, but I wasn’t. I thought “get skinny, wear a two piece”. 

Adding working out has helped. I look forward to being strong. Thick and strong. I joke that my summer goal is to squat my husband (who recently lost 28lvs with Keto and IF).

892,"Hi everyone,

I've been doing Keto since January of this year (seems like forever ago with all this craziness going on around us these days), and it's been going very well. 

I'm approaching 100lbs lost, and will probably make another celebratory post for that occasion lol

I have a question about net calories. My macros are as follows: 1598 calories/105g of fat/136g of protein. I've been following this (and have adjusted it accordingly) since the very beginning, without a single day of cheating. 

As the weight has come off, my activity level has increased in turn. I've been burning 1000 calories a day on average, and consuming 1598 or less. That leaves me with less than 500 net calories on some days.

Is this sustainable? Am I crash dieting? I feel fine, as a matter of fact I feel better than I have in years. I just don't want to cause lasting damage

893,"I don't wanna start too much debate, but I need to start dieting again and I'm not sure which route to go. Long story short, I lost weight on keto, figured I'd go back to a ""normal"" diet and try to just watch it and keep losing weight, and then I stagnated and gained just a little back. Time to say goodbye to carbs again. 

I've lost weight on and off, and always had good success with a somewhat high fat (60, maybe 70% on good days) keto diet, and have struggled to maintain a calorie deficit while still eating carbs (though I've done it). I love avocados, almonds &amp; almond butter, keto coffee, all that good fatty stuff, and of course I love meat (who doesn't). However... I've never tried a high protein carnivore/carnivore adjacent diet. 

I've always felt good when doing traditional keto, but I've heard really good things about the carnivore diet. As I once again quit carbs this time around, is there good reason for me to try a high protein animal-based diet, or should I go back to delicious buttery coffee, guac, and moderate amounts of meat?",1
894,"Hey, r/keto. Long time lurker, first time poster.

This morning, I stepped on the scale and was greeted with a number I probably haven't seen since middle school: 199.8 lbs.

Onederland, at last!

Being obese was not fun. I was out of breath going up the smallest inclines. My lower back ached constantly. My resting heart rate trended towards 100 beats a minute. At only 22 years old, I needed a seatbelt extender on airplanes. I was always the fat kid that kept his shirt on at the pool, and the slow friend that trailed far behind the pack in late-night rounds of Ding Dong Ditch. I sweated constantly, in hot and cold temperatures, especially while eating.

I was also a compulsive yo-yo dieter. After every heart-to-heart conversation with a loved one, I went to the store and bought every low-fat, ""lite,"" and diet product on the shelves, bound and determined to lose weight once and for all. After losing only 5 or 10 pounds each time despite endless starvation, I'd put it all back on again and another 10 pounds for good measure.

I stumbled upon this subreddit and way of eating after a particularly gruesome lipid panel. I weighed 320 pounds, my total cholesterol was 283, my triglycerides were over 400, and my liver was inflamed. My doctor told me that if I didn't get my act together soon, pancreatitis would be the least of my worries.

I started right before Thanksgiving in 2018 (timing has never been my strong suit). At first, the thought of giving up my beloved pizza, pasta, and bread frightened me. Those cravings were quickly filled with eggs, bacon, cheese, steak, salmon, roast chicken, lettuce-wrapped burgers, pork chops, green vegetables cooked in butter, and the occasional bourbon or scotch.

I didn't know anything about nutrition when I first started, and temptation constantly surrounded me. But every time I felt like giving in, I came to this subreddit and read a couple of your success stories to keep me on track. Every time I had a question, you answered it, and gave me the motivation to stay the course.

Losing all this weight was the hardest thing I've ever done, and I still have a little ways to go. My journey has been far from perfect. Despite that, your success strengthened me, and inspired me to go out there and create my own.

From the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you to each and every one of you who have encouraged me along the way. You have changed my life. I truly couldn't have done this without the wealth of knowledge, inspiration, and camaraderie that I've found on this subreddit.

So now, it's time for me to step off the sidelines and give back. We are all climbing the same mountain. As long as you'll have me, I promise to be right here with you, trying to inspire you half as much as you've inspired me. Let's do this!

TL;DR – Thank you.

895,"Hi everyone! W27, H178cm/ 5ft10, SW88kg/ 194lbs, CW68kg/ 150lbs

Long story short I lost the 20kg (44lbs) with a very significant deficit on keto/ IF. Yes I am aware that it might be considered crash dieting, it’s not sustainable for most and leads to muscle mass. It’s a choice I’ve made and I’ve stuck to it the past 6 months (including probably 8 individual weeks were I was off keto here and there). Yes i did loose muscle mass, but I’m still in the high range category based on my height.I have a pretty sedentary job and I did not exercise at all. 
Now I’m nearing my goal weight (65kg/ 143lbs), so weight loss has become less of a priority and most of all, I want to start exercising because this was a stepping stone for me to change my lifestyle and be more healthy all around. 
I know I can’t just raise my calories suddenly as I’ve probably slowed my metabolism, and as much as I was not patient to lose the weight (hence the deficit), I am committed to making the process of “reverse dieting” incremental. 
So here are my questions:
As I am planning to exercise, should my calories consumed increase by the number calories burnt + bi monthly increment?
By that I mean if before my calories in were 1250 and my calories out (exercise) were 0, net calories was 1250.
Going from the same base number 1250, and subtracting calories out (exercising now), of 250, net calories would be 1000.
Theoretically I should thus consume 250 more calories to have the same net as before.
1/ would that be too significant of a jump for my body to process, or does the fact the fact that I am burning them “mechanically” apply?
2/ In this situation, knowing that I am planning to raise my calories upwards of 1700, I am aiming to increase my base number incrementally every 2/3 weeks by 50calories (ie go from net calories of 1250, 1300, 1350, etc). So in the example I have given before with base of 1250, exercise of 250, and incremental increase of 50, I would theoretically consume 300 more calories to increase my base to 1300.
Does that make sense? 
3/ does anyone have better advice?

Many thanks!

Hi Keto Peeps!!

Made these Keto Waffles this morning for a Mother's Day treat and OMG...can't believe they are low carb!!  The recipe is basically a choux dough...but don't be intimidated...it is actually really easy!!

Served mine with some fresh whipped cream and some strawberries and blue berries!

Edit:  Nutritional Breakdown for entire recipe (divide by number of waffles you make for serving breakdown)

Calories: 1230
Protein: 37.1
Fat: 100.4
Net Carbs: 15.7 (total carbs, less fiber and sweetener)


INGREDIENTS

FOR THE KETO WAFFLES

2/3 cup almond flour

1/4 cup coconut flour

1 tablespoon psyllium husk ground

1 teaspoon xanthan gum

1 cup water

1/4 cup grass-fed butter or coconut oil

3 tablespoons erythritol or xylitol

1/4 teaspoon kosher salt

3 eggs lightly beaten **

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder

INSTRUCTIONS


Whisk together in a medium bowl almond flour, coconut flour, psyllium husk and xanthan gum. Set aside. 

Heat up water, butter, sweetener and salt in medium pot (or Dutch oven) until it just begins to simmer. Lower heat to low and add in flour mixture, mixing constantly to incorporate. Continue to cook and stir until the dough pulls away from the pan and forms into a ball, 1-3 minutes. 

Transfer dough back to the bowl and allow to cool for 5 minutes. The dough should still be warm, but not hot enough to scramble the eggs. 

Add in one egg at a time, mixing with an electric mixer until fully incorporated. Mix in vanilla extract and baking powder. The final dough should be very elastic. 

Allow the dough to rest for 10 minutes and heat up waffle iron on high in the meantime. 

Grease waffle iron well and spoon in the batter. It will be thick, so spread it out using a wet spatula (or wet the back of a spoon). Close waffle iron and cook for 8-12 minutes on high until fully golden and cooked through. 

To crisp up the waffles further (this largely depends on your waffle iron), you'll need to toast the pieces on low in your toaster or in a skillet over low heat. This will draw out the moisture from the coconut flour and give you nice and crisp edges. 

The waffles can be stored in an airtight container at room temp for 3 days. And the dough can be kept in the fridge for a day or two.

901,"Title says it all, I'm a 36 year old male currently at 328lb and have been doing Keto now for 3 month. I started at 380lbs and the first couple weeks the weight came flying off and has leveled at nice 2lbs a week average which is all good.

When I first started keto and making sure I hit my macros and caloric intake ranges via Carb Manager I was always hungry and always very tired but I stuck with it.

Fast forward to the past 3 weeks, I'm just straight up not hungry and my energy levels are insane.  I frequently go to bed now at 3am and I naturally wake back up, ready for the day, at 7:30am like clockwork.  The added energy has been nice as I have been doing a ton of yard work and cardio via running a couple miles each day depending on how my sciatica pain feels for the day.

Now this isn't super human energy like after 8 hours of straight digging up my yard and after going for a run I feel tired but after a rest of an hour or two I'm feel just like I did before starting the activity and I still remain wide awake until 3am.

A lot of what I read from people who posted similar topics on this sub said to take the opportunity to start IF so I did that two weeks ago with a single meal per day with ease but even then I have to force down food and I get full so quick.  I'm trying to eat at least 1,200 calories a day because everything online said that was the min you should consume and I've been making sure to hit my proteins for the day as that's what many other posters said but like what gives?

I know my body is chewing through stored fat because I can literally see and feel it.  My once smooth beer belly now looks like a hot lumpy mess with pockets where fat used to be next to mounds of where fat still is.  I had assumed it would come off evenly but surprise, surprise it's coming off in pockets.

I have been working with my PCP and getting monthly blood panels done to ensure everything is good since I have a history of seizures and kidney stones and everything is normal with the exception of my triglycerides which are highly elevated.

I feel perfectly normal and make sure I take my Mutivitamins and drink plenty of water throughout the day but this lack of hungry has me concerned.  The last three days I have only consumer 600 calories per day on average and I feel just fine.  I know 3 days is not a good measure of impact but I thought for sure a couple days of low caloric intake would surely bring on the hunger but it hasn't. So I'm lost on what to do, do I force myself to eat at least 1,200 calories a day or do I follow my body and only eat when hungry?

Also to be clear I measure out everything I eat with food scales and only purchase food that has a nutrition label as I found user submitted entries on Carb Manager vary wildly for the same product.

Sorry for the long post figured it would be better to get it all out there.

902,"Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

For the last two months, I (22F) have been trying to lose weight. I'm 167 cm (5'5) and weigh 94 kg (207 lbs). 

In the past I've lost some weight with the keto diet over a period of 6 months (3 years ago, got to about 83 kg, 182 lbs back then), but I quit because my family quit and then filled the house with carby snacks, causing me to fall back into old habits.

I've also lost weight naturally, while studying abroad two years ago. My diet then consisted of lots and lots of white rice, but also a lot of walking to and from school, so I ended up losing weight until I got to about 80 kg (176 lbs). However, once I came back home the weight started piling up again.

&amp;#x200B;

Now two months ago I decided to try and do keto again, because I figured I've done it before and it worked, why not? At the same time I started working out every other day with my friends online (weight lifting). I haven't worked out during past diet attempts.

But... I haven't lost anything! Neither the scale nor the tape measure has changed during these two months, and I'm feeling a bit demotivated. I don't feel any different physically or mentally either, and didn't experience any keto flu (this was the same during my earlier keto experience). I'm also not at any points in my menstrual cycle where I am retaining more water than usual.

&amp;#x200B;

Using the keto calculator, I calculated that a 20% deficit for my stats should be around 1500 kcals. I've been using My Fitness Pal to track my calories. During the first week I was only getting about 900 kcal every day, because I wasn't feeling hungry at all, so I decided to up it a bit because that was an extreme deficit, and am now trying to eat about 1300-1500 kcal every day. I made sure to stay under 25 grams of carbs every day and get 90* grams of protein, fat I didn't really keep track of as long as I'm not feeling hungry. The carbs I'm getting are mostly from broccoli, cauliflower and other veggies.

Basically I'm doing what worked the last time, but it's not working now.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure there are other posts like this, but most seem to boil down to tracking your calories or macros better, which is something I have been doing, so I'm not sure where I'm going wrong.

Does anyone have any advice?

Thank you so much!

CW 176 / GW 165 

I just wanted to share how much keto has really change my life. I’ve done all kinds of dieting plans, most often intermittent fasting and just eating at huge calorie deficits, throughout my life. For anyone on the fence about keto I just gotta day I truly believe anyone is capable of doing this diet. At this point I feel even my taste buds have changed. I don’t crave my flaming hot Cheetos anymore, instead I go for my sriracha almonds. I no longer feel hungry constantly and I’m not binge eating and snacking through the night. Also I’ve just recently realized that I don’t remember the last time I felt “bloated” and said “I ate too much” after a meal.

NO ONE thought I could stick to this and I was getting plenty of negative statements. Even from family. I was being told I was a “carbasourous” for instance. Anyways, I’m not satisfied with my appearance yet and I do honestly have a bit of body dysmorphia going on but I mainly just wanted to offer my progress and encourage anyone thinking about doing keto.

908,"So I’m 3 days shy of my month mark. I started at 240, I’m down to 231. With the past week up and down 232/231.... I’m 5’8” and 39 year old male... But here is the deal. 

Week 1 I lost 5 lbs quick, which I know was water weight. 

Week 2-4 I’ve lost a total of 4 lbs. 

I’ve very strict about keeping my calories at or under 1800. I’m not hungry most of the time but I eat my protein and fats, keeping my carbs under 25.

I fast from 5pm to 11/12ish, depends on the time I work out. (I don’t eat or drink anything but water during my fast)

I walk 3 miles a day (6 days a week) 

HITT train 2 times a week. 

I drink about 130-150 oz of water a day.

Have about 2 cups a coffee a day with a splash of zero sugar cream and a half a pack of monk fruit. (I only drink this during my meal times)

I sleep about 7 hours a night.

No alcohol, No sweets....


Advice? Motivation? Anything? 

I’m so tempted to say fuck it, and enjoy these pancakes I made for my kids. But I’ve restrained for almost 4 weeks",1

I don't have a huge sweet tooth, and it's usually easier for me to avoid sweets rather than use non-sugar sweeteners (don't like the taste of monkfruit, stevia, etc.). So I'm looking for ideas that may be lower in carbs naturally, without being an actual ""keto recipe"" version of something else.

1120,"Hey guys, got a series of questions and I would love if somebody just gave me a rundown, because I NEED this diet for life and I wanna figure out how to make it work.

I did keto for a month in February and then went off it for a while, now I’m back on it. I’m back on it because I hate the insulin spikes and crashes from carbs and much prefer the stability of this diet.

Note: I track all my intake with MyFitnessPal.

My biggest issue is electrolytes. I need to know how to balance them. I read the FAQ and try to follow their recommendations. Throughout the day I drink ketoade - 1/4 tsp of Half-Salt and 1/4 tsp mixed in 3 cups of water. Should I drink this once a day? Or should I make it twice or even three times? Do I drink it alongside REGULAR water without salt in it? I know drinking too much water can flush out electrolytes really hard. I just wanna feel good so keeping them topped up is important.

Usually I feel okay early in the day, but as the day goes on I start to get a really “dry” feeling like as if I’ve been having too much salt? Then my blood pressure feels like it’s going up so I check it with my home monitor and it’s still in the normal range, usually something like 130/70-80 with like 90 heart rate, sometimes the systolic is higher than 130, which is not normal for me. My regular blood pressure is often 110/70 range with heart rate in the 60s.

Is my blood pressure going up from the salt or is it something else? It’s weird cause it makes me feel not good and then it kinda stabilizes after a bit like maybe half an hour or so.

I JUST got back on keto today, so this is day 1 if that’s any relevance to the fact that maybe my body just isn’t flushing the electrolytes out just yet cause I still have carbs from yesterday retaining water? Not sure.

I really need some advice, if anybody could offer a way for me to feel great on keto forever I’d love it.

Thanks to anyone who has anything to help.",1
1121,"So I'm into my 4th week of keto. It's been pretty bumpy and I think that last week I accidentally kicked myself out. Yesterday i decided to do OMAD and it went really well. Today I wanted to do the same. I got up at 0700 (woken up by my daughter) then at 1030 I went for a light run. beforehand I had taken some electrolytes ( a mix of a magnesium supplement along with a high potassium salt and sea salt). I've been working on my zone 2 jogging these past 4 weeks and so this is a really easy workout. I had been running for 40 mins and was really having a nice time - enjoying my music, had a nice rhythm going, and was in the middle of a large park and enjoying the sun - then suddenly This overwhelming feeling come over me like I was really going to pass out. I had to rip my headphones out, stop and somehow try to exert some control over myself - my vision somehow felt off, though I could actually see everything well, I started to really feel my heart in my chest like there was some sort of pressure there, and I felt like I could no longer fill my lungs with air. I honestly had a few visions of myself dying there in the park, or just passing out and not having any help. I had to phone my partner and she stayed on the phone then eventually came and got me. Now I've had some calorie dense food (eggs, macadamia nuts, mascarpone cream with hazelnut butter and salt) and some more electrolytes and I feel slightly better but still a little out of it.

This isn't  the first time I've felt that  way during this keto diet, the day before I had a similar feeling in the supermarket but less extreme, and about two weeks ago i had another milder version of the same...

Is this just an electrolyte thing despite the fact that I've been supplementing? Or is this something else? e.g. like still not being adapted or the intermittent fasting? I've never had a panic attack before so I don't really buy a ""not all things are due to keto"" explanation, and other things in my life are going smooth and I'm generally very happy so I really think it's related to the diet. Anyone have any ideas?

Thanks!",1

I cant find a relative post here because most posts are about weight loss and about people who had overweight to begin with. So i hope i can find some people here with the same situation i am in now.

I am looking for people (not overweight) who improved their testosterone/estrogen balance due to ketogenic diet. Preferably with bloodwork results.

I also alternate running and strength training and am thinking about fuelling for those events. My research brought me to bulletproof coffee. 

Some people swear by bulletproof coffee. I know it breaks a fast, but from what I understand since it doesn't produce an insulin spike then it is still keto friendly. Am I understanding that correctly?

But I've also seen the bulletproof brand sold with protein added in. But proteins and carbs produce insulin spikes. So does adding protein mean that it is no longer keto friendly? If that's the case, why do they even offer it? Seems counterproductive to me.

I'm trying to keep my protein levels up so that I don't start burning muscle gains from the strength training during my runs.

Ideally, I'd like the fuel from mct oil and ghee in the iced coffee, but also the benefit of protein as well, without the insulin spike.

**Macros - 70% fat 25% protein 5% carbs**

The past couple of days I have been feeling a bit nauseated and hot headed. Saying that though I have been replacing around 1L of my daily water intake with Zero Gatorade the past couple of days so that might be the reason but I have also rechecked my numbers for electrolytes.

I felt bad the whole day (nausea, lack of appetite) until the afternoon and went for a 2 hour walk with a couple of electrolyte packets and felt much better after. However woke up again today feeling the same, not as nauseated but a parched throat and not feeling 100%. I've decided to up my sodium &amp; potassium, magnesium in hopes that it will help this issue.

Right now I'm on a calorie deficit with some intermittent fasting (8-10 eating window), I'm not sure how much of a deficit by but I'm guessing it can't be no more than a 500 calorie deficit a day judging from my numbers and the rate of my weight loss along with calorie estimation.

***My numbers for Mag, Potassium &amp; Sodium are:***

**Magnesium - 600mg-800mg (depending if I take 1 or 2 magnesium pills daily), 520mg without pills**

**Potassium - 3600mg** 

**Sodium - 4700mg from 3900mg**

1386,"Hi all, so I’ve been on strict keto for the past 2 months, and it is working wonders. However, yesterday a coworker of mine gave me like around 6 small pieces of chicken that he called “chicken pie” I think, well actually he insisted I have some and I didn’t wanna be rude, it was a bit hard to understand with the accent, and so I decided to eat some- then ate my usual keto meal for dinner, and after quite a bit I started feeling really nauseated. I was up all night feeling really hungry too, which is weird because I haven’t been hungry in weeks.

I didn’t think much of it though, until today, I did exactly as what I would do everyday, but now I’m just super nauseated. I couldn’t even do my daily workout because I feel like I’m gonna throw up.

I’m guessing those chicken pieces had too high carbs, and I was out of keto all night. That also means, that I’m getting keto flu again, and I don’t know what to do. I don’t wanna skip my workouts, but the nauseous feeling keeps me in bed.",1
1387,"Edited because previous post was removed.

I’ve never been in this state before. I had success with keto in the past, but progress was slow because I’d give myself one allowance day (read: an extreme b*nge day). Also, it ended up not being sustainable because the b*nge would always bring the sugar/bread cravings back. 

The next day, I would feel terrible and start a D*etBet because I knew the weight would fall off eventually. It was just the classic yo-yo in small degrees.

Now, I’m ACTUALLY receiving the effects of keto: my adult acne/oily skin is getting in control. My brain fog is slowly disappearing. Depression has had its hand upon me for years, and it is standing at the exit, waving goodbye. Peace (at least some semblance of ~inner~ peace) is reentering my life. I sleep better. I wake up better. I don’t feel hungry outside of my eating window. What I thought used to be satiety was actually bloating - my brain made false connections that intestinal bloating was really just “feeling full and satisfied”. Glad that’s gone.

I know that the benefits will continue to come, and I’m excited to have seen so many benefits in just a month of taking keto seriously.

1388,"Hi,

I recently became worried about excess pufa consumption...after falling down a rabbit hole realizing my regular use of almond flour was probably not the most environmentally friendly thing. 

I’m pretty lost and looking for help, as I’ve been doing a lot of research (here, online eg [this article/rebuttal on almond flours](https://www.thepaleomom.com/pros-cons-almond-flour-rebuttal-5-reasons-avoid-almond-flour/), [r/ketoscience overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/wiki/vegoil)) etc. 

Adding lots of links for products - though I shop/buy at Trader Joe’s they are often only linkable via amazon (not affiliate or anything..and listed as way more expensive)- in case helpful to you for yourself or in helping me! 

**So some basics about my intake, foods that are likely relevant , and myself:**
- I’m generally rather lazy keto at this point as I’m 125 lbs / 5’7” and have historically had tested as prediabetic. I eat healthy meals but way over snack. gut distress and constipation have been part of my life for many years from another health condition. 
- I had been using grapeseed oil ([amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N3VGZ9Q/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_PZUTEbYWJTFDS)) as my main oil to cook (cast iron) and make homemade dressings, thinking the cheapness and high smoke point = perfect for me. I have some ghee and sesame oil I use occasionally. 
- I often make cookies with [choczero chocolate chips](https://www.choczero.com/products/sugarfree-dark-chocolate-chips) and lemon blueberry mug cakes with blanched almond flour [(amazon link)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01K1E6A3K/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_A1UTEbDYT8GQF)and an egg in each recipe. so In these uncertain times this has been a very regular part of my daily meals. 
- I also often make chia (*omega-3: 1 ounce has 5 grams - ALA*) pudding with coconut milk, flax seeds (*omega-3: 1 ounce has 2.3 grams - ALA*) frozen blueberries and shredded unsweetened coconut.
- also have a **wild** snack addition to eating chocolate chip [quest bars](https://www.questnutrition.com/products/choc-chip-cookie-dough-box-of-12) and [choczero keto bark](https://www.choczero.com/products/dark-chocolate-keto-bark-sugarfree). Lately I’ve also been eating a lot (this is rather “trashy”) “Pb and j’s” with TJ’s carb savvy tortillas with lots of TJ’s unsweetened sunflower seed spread ([amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XNVG81Y/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_YXUTEb7XRAM78)) and Polamer sugar free with fiber strawberry preserves 
- I often snack on the [TJ’s Norwegian crispbread](https://www.traderjoes.com/digin/post/gluten-free-norwegian-crispbread) with cheese 

**i had just returned from TJ’s before this worrying trip into the internet took place with:**
- a large bottle of high oleic sunflower oil (grapeseed was out of stock.. I wasn’t sure if the coconut oil available was refined),
- almond flour and a ton of lemons for my mug cakes,
- and some hemp seeds (*30g/about 1 oz has 2.5g omega-3 and 8.5g omega-6*) to mix up my pudding game (lol). 
TJ’s said I could return it but in these strange times it’d be thrown out :(

**Im now very worried I have an extremely unhealthy ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 as part of my diet. Im definitely way over the recommended amounts of omega 3 ALA (1.1g/day for women) and omega 6, and my ratio is extremely bad. I’m looking to understand things like:**

- how worried should I be about my almond flour intake? I’ll order some more coconut as mine is old! 
- how should I use up this sunflower oil, these lemons, almond flour, and grapeseed oil I have already - safely? 
- going forward, does olive oil for dressings work? I’m not sure which one from TJ’s! And for cooking in a cast iron and seasoning the cast iron? I’m a bit confused about the smoke point.  ([ruled.me keto oils article](https://www.ruled.me/best-and-worst-oils-keto-diet/))
- should I take an omega 3 supplement for EPA &amp; DHA? I don’t really cook fish due to lack of ventilation in my studio. ([ruled.me article 2](https://www.ruled.me/omega-3-omega-6-essential-fatty-acids/)
- any ideas otherwise for what I can do to fix this ratio / change my main daily snacks?! 
FWIW I just signed up for a thrive market trial...

1647,"Hey Reddit, 

I've been on keto for about a month, and have been pretty good about adhering to my macros so far. There have been a couple days where i ate higher carbs (i wouldn't call it a cheat meal, so I hope I'm not violating the rules of the subreddit by talking about this), like a 1/2 cup of rice for example, bringing my daily total to 45-50g net carbs. Both times now I feel slightly gross, mildly uncomfortable stomach feelings, and i'm wondering if this is a common experience for other keto-ers or if I should perhaps explore some previously unknown intolerances?

Now I’m interested in doing longer term water fasts alongside Keto diet (since eating carbs has made me feel incredibly nauseous when breaking my fasts). I very much enjoy doing long term fasts - just finished a 38hr fast this morning and I’m pleased with how it went. 

I’ve never eaten a low carb diet before and I’m not sure how many grams of carbs I should allow myself. Should it be based on my height and weight?

It’s been a while since my last update, primarily because it’s taken a year to lose the next ten pounds. Around this time last year, some management changes transformed a job I had loved for years into a toxic nightmare of stress, and I spent nine months bouncing back and forth between 184 and 186. I was averaging less than five hours of sleep at night, working 12.5+ hour days, and really barely functioning, so honestly it was a MASSIVE victory just to maintain my weight through keto. I have PCOS and I have never maintained weight loss before, so I’m quite pleased that I maintained a weight *under* the obesity limit through such a stressful period.

I relished in non-scale victories during that time, like the fact that for the first time in my adult life I don’t own a single plus-sized article of clothing—I’m a comfortable XL now. I had to reorder my favorite jeans again this spring, and after starting in a 2x two years ago and sizing down to a 1x last year, I was forced to take a leap of faith and order the next size down, a junior’s size 15...and they fit. Keto has given me so much, even when the weight loss stalled.

And then, this March, I moved on from my job into a very different and much less stressful position. Within two weeks, the scale registered 181, my lowest weight in a year. Today I weighed in at 179.4, exactly 75 pounds down from my starting weight, and only 25 totally attainable pounds away from my goal.

The photo above isn’t a great reference, since I don’t actually have a “before” picture. I was too ashamed to look at my body in the beginning, so I had actually already lost more in the first photo than I have between the first and the second. But it’s still remarkable to me. I’m wearing the same shirt in both, and technically the same pants — a 2x in the first photo and a freakin’ junior’s 15 in the second.

Keep calm and keto on, folks. When life throws way too much your direction, having a constant can be a lifeline. For me, one of those lifelines was my way of eating, and now that I’m no longer filling up on stress “bread” each day, my body is responding once again to the best decision I ever made — cutting the carbs and nourishing my soul.",1
1656,"F24 and i started keto last tuesday.  

I ordered premade keto meals (don't judge me), but when i put it into my fitness pal, at best, i'm having 700 calories a day. And I'm looking at myself in the mirror and especially my face doesn't look any different. I say that bc usually when I diet, my face weight is the first to go.

* Weight: 275 lb or 125.3 kg (I did a hypocaloric diet last week and a strict keto (I ate 20g or less of total carbs) since Tuesday and I lost around 4kg I think. I used different scales and my peak, a few months ago, was about 133kg)
* Height: 6'1"" or 185cm

Tuesday I set up my macros on MyFitnessPal at 5/59/36 (C/F/P) and a goal of 1643kcal. Today I used [calculo.io](https://calculo.io) (recommended calculator in the FAQs) and with a 20% deficit (Protein Ratio 0.8g/lbs and 20 net carbs) it showed me these macros:

* Protein: ***150****g*  
* Carbs: ***20****g*  
* Fat: ***151****g*  

Target: ***2034*** *kcal*

I noticed that I can't eat that much these days because I have no hunger and I feel pretty full staying at 1600kcal a day.

I'm going to change my macros ratio keeping 20g of carbs but I don't want to reach 2000 kcal. I want to reach 82.5 kg or 181 lbs in the fastest time possible and then do a low carb maintenance diet. 

Now the questions:

1. Should I attain to the target on [calculo.io](https://calculo.io)? I would lower it periodically following the weight decrease.
2. If I keep myself at around 1600kcal how long would it take to lower my BMR from 2311kcal/day?
3. I am also doing the c25k program. Would it help to keep the metabolism high enough to be at a good level of deficit?
4. I want to set up my macros at 20g C, 150g P, 103g F for a total of 1607kcal. Is it good for my health or it is totally unbalanced? I have a few muscles under my superficial fat and I'd like to keep them. In this way, they should be visible enough at 181 lbs.

It's crazy, like to the point that I look pregnant. It's insane. I feel like it has to be something I'm eating.

Part of the reason I love keto is because my bloating goes away for the most part.

I've heard maybe eyrithrotol? Of that's the case that SUCKS because to cut out eyrithrotol will be very difficult for me.

Does anyone else experience this? What did you end up cutting out to resolve it?",1
1669,"To try to keep this brief, I've been struggling a lot with IBS (constipation, diarrhea, bloating, gas, pain, hypersensitive guts, etc) for about a year now. I've had just about every test done except for a colonoscopy, so at this point we're pretty much positive it's IBS.

My doctor had suggested a low-FODMAP diet to me months ago, and I kind of made a half-assed attempt at it, but I found it difficult to stick to because you have to check every single food for its FODMAP content before you can eat it. If you don't know what a FODMAP is, it's an acronym for a certain kind of carbohydrate that's found in a lot of different foods.

I then went another few months just kind of eating whatever, and often suffering the consequences.

Finally, I realized that I needed to take a hard look at my life and figure out what I could improve. The first thing I did was remove all caffeine and artificial sweeteners. I used to be an absolute caffeine *fiend*, with 2 - 3 sugar-free energy drinks per day (full of nasty artificial sweeteners), as well as often also having a cup or two of coffee.

Removing caffeine didn't resolve my IBS, but it did calm me down and make it easier to look at this analytically instead of emotionally. When I was using (hell, abusing) caffeine, the constant anxiety ups-and-downs frankly made me too emotional to really research this stuff and make a plan. I was just caught up in my suffering.

So at this point I'm trying to make the decision between doing keto, where the goal is just to keep carbs to 20g a day, or to do low-FODMAP where the goal is to just avoid FODMAPs but isn't necessarily low carb.

There's also a third option to do keto AND low-FODMAP (for example, steak and spinach with olive oil dressing is both keto and low-FODMAP friendly). However, if I did this I wouldn't know whether it was the keto or the lack of FODMAPs that was doing me good.

I'm leaning toward just trying keto alone and seeing how that goes, because then I don't have to worry about what I'm eating as long as I know the number of carbs in it. That will allow me to eat things that are high in FODMAPs but may still have beneficial effects on my gut microbiome, such as yogurt.

I guess I won't know until I try- I figure I should pick one and stick with it religiously for a minimum of 90 days. If it doesn't work, I can either switch to the other or try to incorporate both of them. 

I really like the idea of being in ketosis though for the numerous benefits (weight loss, butyrate production, etc). So again, leaning more heavily toward doing keto, although some people with IBS say keto makes them worse.

Thoughts? Sorry, this got longer than I thought it would. I just feel like now that the caffeine is out of my system and I can go a day without an anxiety attack, it allows me to actually focus on goals and work toward them, so I'm pretty pumped to get started!

**TL;DR**: I got stuck in a state of decision paralysis about whether to start doing keto or low-FODMAP for a few months, and now I want to make a commitment. I got caffeine out of my diet as well, which was causing GI upset and anxiety, making it more difficult to stick to a plan or even to tell if something was working for me. So the question is, which path do I choose?",1

My net carbs for the day are at 10g but my total currently is 35 after eating this. What do you all think? Thanks for the advice.,1

1953,"\*cross post from r/xxketo4u2

I came here a year ago looking for inspiration - today I’d like to return the favour,

Today marks one year since an incredibly painful medical diagnosis sent me into Keto’s arms (along with a Calorie Deficit) a choice I had to make somewhat against medical suggestion.  

Reddit provided me with some amazing success stories that I couldn’t find elsewhere.

Today I am one year Keto (&amp; calorie deficit) and have lost 50 kilos exactly (110lbs)

To say my mind is blown is an understatement - why you ask?  Well first of all I’m female - notoriously harder to loose some say, secondly I’m 162cm tall or 5’3” - and thirdly I’m a peri-menopausal 52 year old.

So I can say with certainty that although I didn’t doubt I could loose - I am astonished to find I am in such an amazing place.

Firstly I have to say - prior to starting I’d spent 5 years on and off therapy that unravelled childhood trauma from domestic violence - which was where I was taught and encouraged to use food not as fuel but as a silencer, and numb-er and reward. 

For me if you have a long term, psychological issue that makes food an issue I implore you to love yourself enough to get therapy - the reason this has and is working for me - is that I was READY to no longer use food as anything but fuel.

Secondly for me it’s Calorie Deficit first - I know I needed to and will always need to watch the calories going in no matter how I eat (although I intend to stay Keto for life) - as I’m a short, older, female and there will never be much wriggle room for overeating the calorie numbers.

Thirdly - Keto has completely stopped me EVER EVER feeling hungry and I burn fat now as a priority and that feels amazingly different than any way I’ve ever lived.

I chose to do this journey without any notification to anyone but my health care providers and my immediate family and 4 friends - I have not discussed it - and feel best when I put myself first without the opinions or under the eyes of anyone.

I am extremely happy to say that my health care providers - both mental &amp; physical have wholeheartedly supported my Keto choice as they are progressive professionals who understand that it works if you keep at it.

I hope today just one someone can feel more empowered by my success (thus far) - I still have another 18kgs to go to say I’ve halved myself and I give myself until the end of this year to achieve that.

Oh one last thing - I didn’t exercise for the whole year - I thought I would - but it never happened and I didn’t push it - I have just purchased for myself the most stunning pushbike I’ve named Audrey and I am just starting to ride again after 25 years - I can’t wait to see the results of some muscle appearing on this body that I will forever be grateful for.

Wishing EVERYONE the success they dream of and MASSIVE THANK YOU to everyone who went before me and shared their private journeys with us all - you are ALL my inspiration.",1
1954,"Hopefully someone can help me out..I’m a type one diabetic, and as such have been eating minimal carbs (under 20g) per day as it just makes everything so much easier in regards to controlling my blood glucose.

I’m currently 12 hours into a 20 hour fast as I’ve read that fasting will help get into ketosis, but I’ve already been following the keto diet for the last 3 days (every so often I have a blow out and have carbs, cause why not I guess?)

My question is, as I’ve been following keto for 3 days, would fasting even help at all getting into ketosis? Hopefully I’m explaining what I mean, would my glycogen stores be depleted now anyway after 3 days of keto and working out every day? So technically fasting wouldn’t be necessary?

thankyou in advance!",1
1955,"Does anyone doing keto to reverse pre/T2D/insulin resistance (and lose a small amount of weight) drink alcohol and, if so, have you noticed that it affects your results? I'm a bit confused because I'm seeing two groups of thought on the matter here. For example, some of Dr. Fung and Megan Ramos's work seems to suggest that to reverse insulin resistance, you have to break down fat stored in the liver, and since alcohol is broken down only by the liver, drinking even moderately can slow progress. But it's also clear that a lot of people doing keto can have the odd glass of wine/low-carb cocktail of choice and still see great results.

Pre-keto, I was never a heavy drinker by any means, and I'm fine cutting out alcohol if I need to. But I'm wondering how strict I need to be when I'm trying to reverse what I think is really stubborn insulin resistance. So far, I've been drinking plain Perrier during my social distancing Zoom ""cocktail hours"" (which, to be fair, is probably going to help me drop weight faster, so I'm not complaining).

1958,"I've been on and off keto for around 2 years now, lost a bunch of weight when I started and maintained but slowly been adding back and especially put a lot of weight during this quarantine. 

I want to go on a strict keto diet to lose the fat but everytime I try I get an extremely dry and red skin. I actually have problems with seborrheic dermatitis and it gets way worse when on keto. Red skin around my nose and especially the eyebrows and I get very dry on the forehead. I also get dry eyes as well. 

I've read a lot of posts here about it and videos on YouTube where people talk about it but they just keep saying the same stuff that doesn't appear to work for me: drink lots of water, take care of electrolytes and the occasional eat liver or fish oil thing. I've done all of that, even in a exaggerated manner and it doesn't work on me. It's so frustrating that a diet that fixed so much stuff on me and helped me lose a lot of weight it's pretty much impossible for me to keep following it. The only fix that actually works is to eat carbs, it's enough to eat a pizza for me and the same day I already feel much better. During the Easter holidays I ate a lot of carbs and my skin felt extremely good I had no redness or dryness whatsoever. I'm thinking of just eating a normal high carb diet and look at the calories but I'm always so hungry!

1960,"Hi,

I am looking for helpful suggestions to make my weightloss more efficient long-term.

I have been doing keto for 4 weeks, in which I have lost 3.5 kgs (which is pretty decent as I was aiming for 1 kg a week). However, I'm wondering what I can do differently or additionally to make sure I get to my goal weight.SW: 144 kgsCW: 141.5 kgs

Stats: 27 (F). Macro's: 99g Protein, 20 g (net) carbs, 157g Fat. 1928 kcal/day (includes 20% deficit)

I love (and only) eat chicken (meat wise) so I reach my protein and carb goal every day. I never go above 100g of fat a day (I eat till I'm satisfied; 3 meals a day) and I eat between 1200 - 1500 kcal/day depending on how hungry I am. Although the weight I am losing is not the worst , I am slightly worried about my calorie consumption vs the weightloss considering that I am just starting.

I will start walking 30 min (twice) a day for my health, so maybe that will aid the long-term stable weight loss. Wish me luck. Thanks in advance. :)",1

1963,"I've failed on keto twice. Both times about 7-8 days in. This is what I'm doing:
I do a 42 hour fast before my first keto meal at around 12pm the second day.
I keep am eating window from 12 to 6pm in which I eat two meals
I make sure to eat 5 cups of veggies 
Of course I avoid eating more than 50 grams of carbs.
Each morning I take about a teaspoon of ground pink Himalayan salt.
I exercise 30m to 1h each morning. More like 30m the first days and then I start being able to do more.

The fist time I broke it was because I felt extremely cold even though it was around 20 degrees (celsius) outside. Maybe I wasn't over the keto flu yet and definitely could have pushed it another day to see what happened.

The second time I started trembling and feeling extremely weak and cold in the morning, I had had a bulletproof coffee but I'm not sure it was the cause since I had one a day before and this didn't happen.

I also constantly feel my heart pumping stronger than usual (not necessarily faster) and I've both left it alone and had some lo salt which has potassium in it and it seems to have no effect on the palpitations.

So what could I change?",1
1964,"So obviously within a consistent caloric deficit, your bound to lose weight no matter the diet. And of course it's no different with keto, or is it?

I first did keto Jan. 2019 in hopes to drop around 20lb, I ended up losing 30lb in about 3-4 months, hitting just under 180lb. It was the first time I ever tried it, and didn't do nearly as much research on it as I have now present day. I was very lazy with it, didn't eat at a caloric deficit (2000+ cal daily) ate an average of 26g net carbs daily, rarely ever under 26g, and even often times over it, pushing +30g. My macro profile was a 70/25/5 ratio. 

Based on my weight at that time (6'3"" 207lb), my BMR was 2035 cal. daily, and my TDEE maintenance calories were 2417 cal. I ate somewhere between that range on an almost daily basis, rarely ever going under that limit, even some times going way over, pushing +3000 cal. I don't know if this community bases their caloric deficit on their BMR or sedentary TDEE, and tbh I don't really know the difference.

Learning more and more about keto as time went on, I was ignorant to the whole caloric deficit aspect of it, and learned that keto is more about the fact that it really helps kick cravings, which naturally over time you just tend to eat less and less because you aren't as hungry. My impression was always that if your body is producing ketos you're just naturally gonna burn body fat, which I now know isn't necessarily the case. 

I guess I'm just looking for some sort of explanation as to how I managed to lose so much weight on a keto diet while eating more calroies that I was supposed to. To be fair maybe youth was on my side, if that makes any sense? I was 22, going on 23 at the time, exercising 3-4 times a week for maybe an hour of the day,  (nothing crazy just body weight stuff, push ups, pull ups, core, tricep dips, some dumbbell training; bicep curls and shoulder presses/raises), working as a stock clerk at a grocery store 20-30 hours a week. The labor wasn't really intense and I can't imagine I was expending that much energy.

TL;DR - does a caloric deficit truly matter on a ketogenic diet? I believe my experience might prove otherwise seeing as I very lazily followed my calories. Does anyone else share a similar experience? Or could possibly explain what happened in my situation? Thanks!

2278,"I've been prediabetic for a year and was finally diagnosed as T2D on Monday with an A1c of 6.4 and an FBG of 126. Over the past year, my fasting blood sugar has been in the 100-120 range, and I haven't ever seen an A1c below 6.0. At diagnosis, my doctor prescribed me metformin. He also suggested that I would likely need it for life, and hopefully that would keep my T2D from progressing any further by preserving the beta cells that I have left. I have dabbled in low-carb, so I asked about keto and if I should try that first. My doctor said he was skeptical of keto and that I was doing everything right, so I probably just needed an extra ""kick"" from metformin.

Well, this just wasn't good enough for me. I'm not anti-pharmaceutical, and I know that certain drugs save many people's lives, but I'm very skeptical of mainstream healthcare, Big Pharma, and ""big grains."" (That being said, I'm taking the met as directed until I can discuss dose reduction and/or discontinuation with my doctor!) I'm also 28/f, normal weight, and very active, and I quite frankly don't want to depend on a pharmacy for decades of my life if there is another way to get control of my blood glucose.

After my diagnosis, I decided to figure out what i was causing my high sugar readings despite following a grain-free, ""low-carb"" (\~75/day) paleo diet and got a cheap glucose monitor from Walmart (note to all pre/T2D: DO THIS ASAP!!) I binge-read Jason Fung's ""Diabetes Code"" and gathered tons of info from Dr. Fung and Megan Ramos, metaphorically flushing the dying-pancreas-progressive-disease model of T2D/insulin resistance down the toilet.

This is day three of eating 10g total carbs/day and what could be described as a somewhat modified fat fast that I'm sticking to until I figure out what else I can tolerate. I have been eating mostly salmon/bacon/eggs/high-fat cheese/avocado/cream cheese. I don't count calories and I think the CICO and IIFYM models are bunk--at least for me (but again, n=1). I'm also drinking nothing but plain water, black coffee, and unsweetened tea. My eating window (I've done time-restricted eating for years, mostly out of convenience and because I get nauseous eating in the morning) has been between 2-6 PM, although I'm working to level out my sugar ranges, so I might adjust this depending on today's readings.

Tentative results: I've been logging multiple readings per day--FBG, pre-prandial, post-prandial, post-exercise, bedtime, and even early morning. After only 36 hours of 10g carbs/day, I have seen dramatic results, measuring within the normal to high-normal range for blood glucose for a healthy (not even pre-diabetic) person! Yesterday, my fasting sugar was 86, and I was certain this was an error. But it was 86 again this morning!!! My PPG has ranged between 105 (!!!) and 137. Oh, and I also dropped two pounds (likely water weight) literally overnight.

I know n=1 and it's way too soon to call myself a success, but I'm planning on sticking with keto due to what is clearly a genetic carbohydrate intolerance and very serious insulin resistance. Three doctors had dismissed a genetic link for me because none of my relatives have full-blown T2D, but everyone on my mom's side is prediabetic or has ""a little bit of high sugar"" despite being active and normal weight to very thin. I'm convinced I'm from a long line of TOFIs (Fung/Ramos term for normal-weight person with insulin resistance) who just simply can't handle carbs.

If anyone is reading this after being diagnosed with prediabetes/T2D, please try keto, even if your doctor is skeptical! Also, get a glucose monitor as SOON as you are diagnosed--it's nearly criminal that doctors don't recommend frequent testing at the first sign of prediabetes. I'm now hoping to get off the metformin eventually (although I'm considering just stopping it--I've only managed to take three 500mg tablets total, one per day, due to GI symptoms from hell, combined with other weird side effects like sweating and dizziness???). But of course, this will depend on how my next A1c goes and what my doctor recommends.

Also, thanks to everyone who posts here; it's nearly impossible to find medical/dietetic support for keto where I am (rural midwestern USA), and I wouldn't have known about keto or how to start if not for this forum. THANK YOU!

2282,"A year ago, I got very sick. I was in the hospital writing a goodbye letter to my kid in case I didn't make it home. That's when my doctor asked me if I had ever heard of Keto. 

I had, actually.  My spouse had recently started it. It seemed crazy and impossible, though he swore it made him feel better. But... Bread! Pasta! Sweets! How could I live without carbs? I had already given up dairy due to lactose intolerance. Would life be worth living without carbs too?  But as I was there in the hospital it came down to whether I loved my family more than bread. No-brainer. And while I felt like I couldn't live without carbs, my doctor was saying I was certainly not going to live much longer WITH them either. 

I went on keto immediately. 

A year later I am 50 lbs down. No longer need blood pressure meds. I no longer am sick all the time. No more migraines. No more constant gastro-intestinal distress. (well except when I don't get enough fiber, but that is fixable). Oh, and the best part - No more lactose intolerance!!!!! I got dairy back!!! I can eat all the cheese! It turns out that my issue was only when dairy combined with carbs. I had to pick one or the other. But dairy alone gives me no problem. (Before with carbs+dairy, I would be doubled on the floor like I was being stabbed) Ice cream is out because of the carbs from sugar. But cheese!!! How I missed you!

Keto was hard for me. I LOVE food. (I am addicted to food too) I also didn't lose weight at all for months and months at a time while my spouse dropped 85lbs like it was nothing.  I still miss croissants and brownies. But it isn't overwhelming anymore. I still have a lot more weight to lose. It is hard and slow. 

But no matter how hard keto gets, it is infinitely better than my kid having to read that goodbye letter.

2283,"To keep this as brief as possible, I started keto because I felt like I got type 2 diabetes (because I was a sugar addict).

After 3 weeks on keto I dropped 20 pounds, feel like most of my symptoms are gone or are way less severe and in general feel great. Couldn't ask for more honestly. Here's the issue tho, keto foods make me EXTREMELY nauseous. I skip many meals because I don't want to deal with the nausea and recently even added IF to my plan. But I'm still nauseous.

At this point I want to give up keto but at the same time need to keep my diabetes and weight in check. So my question is will I lose the same amount of weight and keep my blood glucose in the safe if I switch to Intermittent fasting? 

P.s if I do switch that also means eating normal carb foods (still gonna avoid sugar tho)",1
2284,"I started my weight loss journey at 385lbs, I am currently down to 345 in just a month. The last week I have only lost about 1lb. I have heard that a cheat meal or day will kick start the weight loss again, but I don’t want to lose my drive by cheating. How do I over come this plateau? What should I do to start losing weight again? Should I cheat a little then go back strict?",1
2285,"Hii guys . I just wanted to know whether keto diet combined with one meal a day (OMAD) eating pattern would cause hair loss. I have put on a lot of weight during this quarantine period around approx 15 kg (33 pounds). My objective is to lose this extra weight and some more and to get ripped.

I was constantly smoking weed everyday during this  quarantine period. Because of that I had the weed munchies and was eating unhealthy food all the time, anything that I could get my hands on like cookies, cakes , chocolates etc. Though I have quit smoking weed now and I don't wanna smoke weed ever again . It made me fat and demotivated.

I am planning to start keto diet combined with OMAD from tomorrow along with daily jogging/running for an hour plus lifting weights from next month since all gyms are closed now. And my meal time would be in the evening around 8 pm after finishing my run.

I have never tried keto diet ever in my life. Although in the past I used to follow OMAD pattern but I ate healthy that time including all the macros carbs, fats , proteins , fruits , fibres etc. So I'm fairly comfortable with OMAD pattern.

So my question is would following the keto + OMAD pattern cause some hair loss. Or should I just stick basic OMAD along with all the macros. Thank you.",1

Any other T1Ds on here? I’ve been doing keto for 17 days and my blood sugars are better than they’ve ever been in my whole life (I mean obviously, low carb- it makes sense). I typically average between 45% to 55% in range. And since on keto, my average has consistently been between 85 to 95% in range. HUGE jump.

Also - I am wondering if anyone knows, is it possible to do cheat days with keto? I assume that takes you out of ketosis if you have a cheat day. I would love to stick with keto until I get to my goal weight, but can’t see doing it forever. Does anyone have any tips or tricks to be able to do something like a cheat day and then jump back onto keto?

My last question - I got a weird rash on my stomach and I’m guessing, after researching a little bit, that it’s a keto rash. Has anyone else experienced this? How long does it take to go away?",1
2287,"Hi all 

So just thought it would be neat to finally post some progress on my keto journey. I've been a long time lurker here and actually started to do regular strength exercises and cardio 2 years ago without changing my diet. 

It worked great - I gained muscles and was filled with energy, but I still had plenty of fat covering my muscles, so I began on keto last august and the weight have just gone down. I went from 108 kg (roughly 238 lbs) to just 81 kg  (180 lbs). I still need to shred some more fat, but my body has never been better. Still want that sixpack ;)

So if you are thinking of loosing some weight, then I can definitely recommend keto. It works, but you have to stay committed and working out definitely speeds up both your motivation and your weight loss. 

Here are the before and after pics, which is a picture from before I started working out and eating properly and a pic from yesterday (had to do a screen capture from myfitnesspal, since I dont have the before picture on my phone anymore).

2290,"I've been feeling Not Great (dizzy/lightheaded on standing up, tight chest during workouts, generally lethargic) for the past few weeks, so I decided to be more rigorous about measuring my electrolytes.

Context:

* I had blood tests done about 6 months ago (I was keto then too), and liver / kidney functions were normal (as were plasma electrolyte concentrations).
* I do 20:4 IF (a 4 hour eating window) and eat &lt;20g net carbs per day. I usually don't measure electrolytes, but the past few days it's become clear I'm missing the mark.
* After measuring, I realized that I've been getting &lt;1200mg Potassium daily from food (total, while the RDA is \~3500mg including supplementation - the FAQ's recommendation of 1000mg is not including food). I've also been getting \~4000mg Sodium.  


So seems pretty clear I'm not getting enough potassium - but in the past, adding electrolyte supplements has made me feel worse rather than better so I've never stuck with it. Today I put 1/2t of Lite Salt in 28oz of water (\~700mg potassium, \~500mg sodium) and have been sipping it over the course of the whole day. Sure enough, it made me feel worse rather than better. I get anxious, have a hard time concentrating, and feel a little bit more tingly.

Since I'm pretty far under the RDA and don't have kidney problems, it seems incredibly unlikely I'm suffering from hyperkalemia, so I'm trying to come up with other theories.

My current intuition-based theory is maybe there's a rebound effect where adding more potassium for someone who's deficient actually makes them feel worse while their body adapts.

Has anyone else had any experiences where supplementing electrolytes made them feel worse before they felt better? If not, what's your alternate theory?",1
2291,"Hey guys. I've done keto a year ago and it has helped me be a healthier version of myself. Unfortunately, due to my financial situation, I couldn't keep buying chicken and meat anymore. Nor magnesium supplements (we don't have broccolli where I live) I live in a 3rd world country where meat is expensive and I'm unable to get treatment for my inflammation diseases. I did keto for health reasons, for my chronic nasal inflammation which prevents me from sleeping. I did keto for months then stopped and oh boy how it changed my body! Another year passed without keto and I'm unable to endure it anymore. It's affecting my quality of life and increasing my stress levels. 

I live in a village, and we made a deal with a farmer who delivers for us milk each week in which we transform it to homemade greek yogurt. We also raise chickens, however I can only eat two eggs a day. Anyway, If I eat 2 eggs + 16 Tbs of yogurt everyday, I would only be eating 32 g of protein. Can I sustain myself with half of the quantity of protein required for my weight? I'm going to take a shot and try it. What do you think guys? I'm 20 F and about 147 lbs.

I have tried eliminating possible foods that trigger my nasal congestion and have come up with possible trigger foods (mayonaisse + chips+ juice) I felt temporary relief after I eliminated them (while eating carbs), but for some reason my nose is flaring again (I ate fried cauliflower, eggplants, and potatoes yesterday) and I can't take it anymore

It seems carbs (which are 90% of my diet) are the reason for inflammation itself. I cannot do surgeries for my nose where I live. Tuna is expensive where I live and although sardines are not pricey they taste awful for me without bread and potatoes. So what can I do guys? Am I a hopeless case? Is there nothing I can do? And thanks.",1
2292,"Hi there. I don’t post much here, but I peruse this sub a lot since I’ve been following a keto and ADF protocol since August of 2019 thanks to the work of Dr. Fung. 

Anyway, there is a question I’ve had in the back of my mind for as long as I’ve lived (I’m 27). Can insulin resistance be caused by factors outside of lifestyle and diet? I have ALWAYS had problems with my weight. Like I was chubby as a child. And middle school. Got obese in high school. Morbidly obese in college. I started my period when I was 8 and was diagnosed with PCOS ten years later. It just seems as if I have always had insulin resistance. Granted, I didn’t eat wonderfully in middle/high school, but I also didn’t eat like total shit and generally ate a normal amount as my friends. 

So much of my life seems to point to having insulin resistance from a very young age. And insulin resistance is what causes PCOS. Something I heard from Dr. Fung, that he didn’t elaborate a whole lot on, is that the environment in which a fetus is born can affect the health of the child significantly. He said that if a child is growing in a high-insulin environment, that they can be born with hyperinsulinemia. I asked my mom what her health was like when she was pregnant with me, and she admitted she was obese. If she was obese, it’s very likely she had high insulin levels. 

This all leads me to wonder if the circumstances of my birth are why I have always had issues with weight and insulin resistance. And I also wonder if there are particular genes that make some people more prone to insulin resistance as well. It’s a very interesting topic to me, but I don’t see this talked about much. Most people are focused on diet/lifestyle leading to insulin resistance, which is certainly true for many people, but I wonder how many people have been messed up from birth due to being born in a hyperinsulinemic environment?

Would love to hear thoughts on this subject!",1

2294,"Now before you all yell at me, I’m not saying that to be a contrarian. I have a few concerns about keto- 


1. I’ve been on keto for just four days- and have actually lost 2 pounds already. The first two days I lost barely any weight, but now I’ve lost a pound per day. To me that sounds crazy but a little like- too quick? It’s a bit worrisome.

2. Also I’ve heard about how dietists don’t recommended this diet on places like tiktok, saying how carbs don’t actually make you gain weight and stuff? This doesn’t seem like a very researched diet because it’s so new.

3. When I get off keto, I have a fear that the weight will come back instantly or very quickly. So I fear that if I stay on this I’ll never eat another sweet again.

If you’re an expert, what are your thoughts?",1
2295,"On keto, obviously I eat a ton of eggs, beef, chicken, salmon.  I also eat liver about once a week and take cod liver oil daily.  And I do daily electrolyte powder, so I'm set on that.

2296,"Sometimes eating keto friendly foods like avocados can seem like a chore. Cream cheese has changed that for me in a big way. I make a tasty sauce using two ingredients, cream cheese and beef or chicken stock. Heat up a little olive oil or coconut oil on low heat, add cream cheese and mix it a little, next add beef or chicken stock. Stock is salty so a little goes a long way, no additional salt necessary. Add water or unsweetened almond milk to your desired consistency and boom you’re done. This tasty sauce can he drizzled on anything to introduce a nice burst of flavor. I put it on vegetables mainly . It makes bland food taste decent.",1
2297,I am curious as to how you handle a ketogenic diet after you achieve your goal.  Do you just go back to eating whatever you want and face the consequences?  Do you keep eating keto and keep losing weight?  What is the transition after you've accomplished what you set out to do?,1

I have practiced keto on and off over the years, luckily I started right before this pandemic going 2 months strong and seeing results so I would like to dig a little deeper.

Vitamins. I admittedly do not eat enough vegetables. Currently I am only taking a capsule if krill oil.

* Is a regular daily multivitamin enough to make up for lack of nutrients? 
* Is there a specific vitamin blend/multi that you recommend? 
* Do I just need to stop being lazy and eat more vegetables? 
* What other supplements should I be looking into, if any?

Fiber. 

* If I take a fiber supplement can I subtract that from my daily carb intake, or does that on apply to the fiber in the food? EX: a serving of food has 5g carbs 3g fiber, 2g net carbs, IF the food in question didn't have any fiber would the fiber supplement still factor into net carbs?

Random question. 

* Are all the products you see in ads that are marketed for keto just 'snake oil' and targeted marketing, or are there actually decent products out there? (Ex: Keto specific multivitamins)

I appreciate your help. KCKO!",1
2299,"I have a couple of cronometer questions. I looked at the details of my carbs today and I don’t understand how they calculated the net carbs? None of these numbers add up to me.

I want to make sure it’s adding up accurately because if it’s not, I’ve been going over 20.

I got my macros from a app. I’m allowed 22g of carbs a day. Achieving ketosis here no problem. If my body can handle say 25g of carbs will the weight loss be the same?

2633,"I've made a couple of other posts in this sub, and now I finally get to write my success post! Not that they haven't all been success posts, but at least this one is my ""goal achieved"" post. :D

August 8, 2019 - 272 days ago, my wife and I decided that we were tired of being obese. 272 days ago, I made a difficult decision. Something that would change my life. Not only was I tired of being fat, but I wanted to be one of those people whose story might actually be able to help somebody else. I'm sure we've all seen one or two miraculous youtube videos, where the person has lost an extraordinary amount of weight and made a life changing switch. I wanted to be able to see my youngest kid (just over a year old at the time) grow up. I needed to add years, decades hopefully, to my life. 

These last few pounds have been seriously difficult to drop. I've spent way longer in the upper 190s than I would like to admit, but, now that it's happened, I'm pretty excited. My goal weight, such as it was, was to get to a non-overweight BMI. This morning, I met that goal: 194.3 pounds, BMI of 24.9. I've never really bought in to the whole BMI thing, but I know that some do, so I figured it would be a good target to aim for.

This is most definitely not the end though. It's just the beginning. I'll not actually consider my goal achieved until I can maintain this for at least a week. I don't think it'll be too difficult, but we shall see. The life changing goal will be to maintain everything that has been done indefinitely. 

I was never really big on photos, so I don't have many decent ""before"" images at my disposal. I did get progress shots, but those are more for myself than anything. Here are a couple of comparison images:

Hey guys in a bit of a dilemma,

So I restarted keto in the month of Jan weighing around 114.5kgs/ 252 lbs and by mid March I weighed around 90 kgs / 198 lbs ever since then I’ve lost only two kgs.

I started body weight anaerobic exercises on March 16th and started picking up weights at home start on 30th April.

I’m a bit confused as too how to set my macros as I’m not losing weight and not seeing relatively greats gains muscle wise 

I still have a lot of fat in the upper body (chest/back/stomach)

MACROS:
Calories : 1647
Carbs - 20 g
Fat -  124 g
Protein - 120 g

I also follow IF 16-8 /2 meals a day

Do I reduce my fat and increase protein ? Or do I get out of a caloric deficit ?

By that time, I had lot's of chest and abdominal pain that doctors couldn't pin point a cause and that actually seemed **skeletomuscular** actually.

The first few days of home-office made me quite abandon the strict keto diet: I ate rice a few times, and even some pasta. Unexpectedly, I even dropped some weight (79 Kb,  174 lbs).

After adapting to the home office routine, I adopted a more strict diet again in the last few days, and, to my surprise, yesterday and today I got ache in my ribs and upper back. When it came back, I realized I've been free from them for quite some time. It seems muscular in nature.

I've done keto before and in the first few days I had the typical keto flu and after 4 days my appetite reduced signifigantly and I lost 4 kg in the first 10 days.

I had no keto flu, so I just thought my body was adapted but then my appetite didn't seem to reduce. On the contrary I'm hungry most of the time now, hungrues than without keto. 

But even through all the hunger I made sure I ate 1450 kcals a day(1800 kcals is my maintainence calories) and walked enough to burn 300 kcals a day. So my average calorie defecit is 650 kcals, which should be enough to lose 0,5 kg a week.

 I didn't lose any weight, which is strange because most people drop a lot of water weight in the first week of keto.

Last time on keto I did lazy keto and didn't watch my calories and did so good, but now I'm focusing on healthy fats and excercise and that has resulted in nothing.

For the first 4 weeks of dieting I was only doing gentle exercise (about 30 mins walking a day) but after the first 4 weeks and the first 30lbs had gone I started increasing the intensity. I started introducing HIIT cardio sessions to try and keep things fun, and also started going to the gym every other day. For the past 4 weeks I've been doing an arm's/chest &amp; back/shoulders split whilst doing abs and legs everyday I'm training. I have noticed an absolute huge difference in everything in my life so much so that my Dad even said he doest recognise me from a distance. This journey has opened up so many more doors for me and has not only massively improved my physical health but also my mental health as well. Turns out actually being proud of what you look like rather than feeling disgusted by yourself makes you feel a lot better about yourself. I used have constant back and general joint pain which is mostly gone now and also feel more confident in myself. There was a few questions I wanted to ask in general about others experiences on the ketogenic diet. 

Do you find you get less hungry as your diet goes on? 

What do people use as replacement for snack food? ( I used 85-90% dark chocolate and unsalted mixed nuts) 

How quick do other people lose weight on the ketogenic diet? (Most articles I have read on healthy fat loss recommend 1 lb a week but I have lost on average 7lbs a week or 1lb a day and wanted to know if I should be worried about anything health wise) 

Thanks for reading and answering the questions.",1
2649,"So one of the biggest things for me whilst working to get into ketosis was missing texture, and also missing the fact that I could just grab a packet of crisps (Chips for our US brethren). I mean pork rinds are great, but after a while the same “go to” snack gets very dull.

This recipe literally saved my Keto Soul, and restored much needed crunch back into my diet!


Microwave Cheesy Crisps.


Choose one or a combination of the following options:

Shredded cheese
Cheese sticks
Ultra Thin Slices
Regular cheese slices
Optional: very thin slices of jalapeño pepper*
Instructions

Cut a piece of parchment paper the size of your microwave turntable and place it on the turntable.
For the shredded cheese: Place slightly rounded tablespoonfuls on the parchment with a couple inches of space between them.


For the cheese sticks: Cut in quarters and place 2 quarters side by side on the parchment. (Each cheese stick will yield 2 crisps.) Make as many as desired, leaving a couple of inches between each one.


For the Ultra Thin slices: Fold each slice in half, then in half again, spacing as directed on the parchment-lined turntable. Each Ultra Thin slice will yield 1 crisp.


For the regular slices: Fold each slice in half and then break into two even pieces. Break each piece in half again. Stack 2 quarters on top of each other, forming 2 piles per slice, spacing as directed once again.


Microwave on full power for approximately 2 minutes for all but the thin slices. They will take about 1-1/2 minutes. (Helpful hint: Until you know the precise cooking time in your microwave, I recommend checking 30 seconds early, and then microwaving in 15- to 30-second intervals, or until the cheese is crisp and golden.)


Allow the crisps to cool enough to touch. Remove to a paper towel. Wipe the parchment with another paper towel and repeat as often as desired.


Once cooled, eat and enjoy, and store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature.


Notes


*If using the optional jalapeño, place 1 thin slice in the center of the uncooked cheese and cook as directed.

2650,"It all started almost a year ago when I injured my groin during a soccer match. Ive been running for the last 5 years which helped me lose weight and maintain it, after the injury I started slowly gaining weight until i hit almost 200 lbs.

When the whole coronavirus situation started I took it as an opportunity for no more distractions, no more drunken weekends and donuts days at the office. So far its been amazing, Im running again and while the only downside is that ita really difficult for me to run more than 30 mins due to the lack of carbs (you start to feel a black hole in the stomach)  ive been enjoying it so far

My best tip: buy an air fryer, it changed everything.",1
2651,"Hello my friends and family, I have found a KETO squash, and well it’s not advertised as keto but when mixed with water 1 pint is 0.5g of sugar and 0.5g of carbs and also comes with minerals and vitamins, I can see on the back their are artificial sugars (as expected) I was wondering if this would kick me out of keto?

I struggle to drink a gallon and a half of water a day and I think this could ready help, I had one pint made it really weak just in case and still loved it, had a second one, felt super bloated and full after but it stopped me from pigging out on food for ages, one cup is 4 calories.

Is this okay to continue to make sure I am still getting my water intake? I feel it would be better to drink this than to drink sugar free soda PLEASE HELP! 😁😁",1
2652,"Starting Keto

I am planning on starting a keto diet tomorrow for muscle gains and some “skinny fat” loss. My maintenance calories are around 3400-3500 (ectomorph) and I have access to gym equipment so I am able to do my PPL routine - what should I know before doing this?",1
3005,"305lbs was my highest weight on the scale at the doctors office.  I’m 141 pounds now through a ketogenic diet, counting calories, weighing/measuring food, and getting help in therapy to deal with my binge eating. I still would like to lose another 10-15 pounds but since I have gotten my BMI under 25 it’s been much slower and wanted to make an update now. 

Size 28 to size 10 clothes or a 4x to medium. No more acne, backaches, or fatigue. At 5’5 my BMI went from 50 to 23, I’ve lost more than half my body weight but gained my life back as most of my health problems are now gone and existing doesn’t hurt anymore.

3006,"Good morning! Today marks 2 weeks of following the keto diet and I’ve lost 9 lbs so far! I’m not really having trouble sticking to the diet and rather than counting carbs, I create rules for myself like “I can either have berries and veggies OR 2 low-carb tortillas in one day”. This helps keep me from obsessing over getting carbs as low as possible. 

Over the last few days, I’ve had trouble meeting minimum caloric intake each day, which is recommended to be no lower than 1200 calories. Yesterday I didn’t even get close to that! I had 3 eggs (cooked in bacon fat) with mozzarella, 2 slices of bacon, and half of a 160 calorie protein shake for the whole day. I estimate this to be around 700 calories and I honestly didn’t feel the need to eat anymore. 

At first, I thought I might be able to do calorie cycling just based on my hunger level on a given day. I assumed waking up today, I’d be especially hungry but I went to make my usual breakfast (listed above minus the protein shake), and I was full before finishing half. I tried to push through and got most of it eaten, but it was tough!

I’m mildly concerned because of what I’ve read about your body going into “starvation mode”, slowing metabolism, etc. and I’m just looking for any information that y’all may have about this. Specifically, does this work differently on keto because your body is adjusted to burning fat? Should I force myself to eat 1000-1200 calories a day? And if so, do you have any tips about how that can be accomplished without making yourself feel sick/stuffed? 

It might also be important to mention that I prefer to eat as few times a day as possible at this point because eating doesn’t interest me anymore (I have to psych myself up to go eat something or I just won’t). 

Thank you so much in advance!",1
3007," 

So... after a year on keto (and  almost 90 lost pounds), I saw that Papa Murphy's had keto friendly pizza  tubs!  Now, this used to be one of my favorite go-to places for food  pre-keto, so I was notably excited to see that I could now order a crustless pizza.

Ahhh, all of  those delicious melty goodness memories came flooding back.  Fathead  dough will only get you so far folks, so I was all-in on this!  XLNY?   XLN - OH MY!

I put in my order and  anxiously counted down the 30 minutes they asked me to wait.  I looked  at the photos of the giant overflowing tub of deliciousness that was  coming while I waited.  I arrived at the restaurant and stood in line  for another 15 minutes, as they only wanted 4 people in at a time due to  the virus.  Even with my face mask on, I could already taste the  goodness that was sure to be coming in another hour or so.

As  I got called in, I rushed up to the counter to claim my prize!  A year  in the making... could it be as good as I had remembered?  Would I miss  the crust?  ""Damn the crust"", I thought.  ""The prize is the toppings""!

As  the gentleman behind the counter turned to pull out my order, I swear I  almost heard the sound of angels... then IT happened.  The gentleman  handed me a plastic tray filled with 15 meager ounces of food,  consisting of about a tablespoon of sauce, a tiny mix of very diced up  veggies, and 4 and 1/2 slices of pepperoni (do you think they could  spare it)?

That wasn't the worst.   The menu price for this single food item... $19!  Yes, almost 20  dollars for 15 ounces of pizza toppings!  WHAT? The menu says ""serves  8"".  That less than 2 ounces per ""serving"".  How can this be?  I asked  again, ""This is twenty dollars""?  The cold response came back quickly in  the affirmative, and I scoffed.

The  lady in line next to me even shook her head and made a comment about  that being ""ridiculous"" or something.  That may not have been exactly  what she said, as she was barely audible.  It was probably her mask, but  I'm quite convinced it was the ringing in my ears from the  disappointment.

I was determined  not to let them take such advantage of me after all of my keto progress  and was ready to walk out in protest, but what choice did I have?   Dinner was already set and a ""regular"" XLNY pepperoni pizza was also  attached to the order.  You see, this was the first time my wife was  going to eat a REAL pizza in the same amount of time as I had been  dieting.  My loving wife, who has not only tolerated my diet, but urged  me on and joined in.

She has  endured my half-baked (pun intended) keto cookery for a straight 14  months now, with nary a compliant about not getting bread, milk, sugar  or any of the other usual suspects in our past meals.  How could I let  these guys disappoint **HER** after all of that?

I  relented and pulled out the credit card.  I was, for once, glad that  the mask I was wearing blocked the look of disgust on my face as I  entered my pin number.  I felt betrayed and was determined that I would  email corporate that very night to lodge my complaint.

After  my ""dinner"", I immediately sent the attached photos with my opinion to  their corporate consumer email.  ""Maybe they messed it up at the  restaurant"", I thought, trying desperately to believe that my old  favorite place to get food would not stick it to their customers like  this.

Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed when they did not even bother to respond.

I  wanted to share this experience with the community before anyone else  gets taken in by them.  It has become clear that, like many others, they  just jumped on the ""keto"": bandwagon and smelled a quick buck.  It's  too bad really, as I had hoped to return again and again, but now it  will be never again.

In case you  think maybe the toppings are just that expensive, I also want to add  that the regular (GIGANTIC) pizza ordered with my meal was half the  cost!  Only $10.00 and and an entire family can get a meal.  My $20 meal  went fast and was hardly enough for a single ketoer, much less the  eight they claimed this would feed!

Anyone else here hoodwinked by this?

3008,"Hi Everyone.......thanks for all the posts I've been reading. 

I've hit another stall at 220lbs and this time i'm determined to break it.  Posting here for some accountability. 

I've linked to three graphs [Graphs](https://imgur.com/a/1e9H5nQ)

1. The last 2 months where you can see a stall @ \~220lbs for the past month
2. My all time weight since i started tracking in MFP in 2017 (Here you can see multiple losses &amp; rebounds. I've excuses for them all but really they are just excuses.)
3. My 2020 Keto losses (34lbs lost in 4.5 months - consistently 2lbs a week)

I've always had success with Dirty Keto and all my losses have been Dirty Keto but I've always failed to get below 220lbs consistently &amp; maintain. I guess i'm a poster boy for the 'ketobashers' in that i find it unsustainable. I've recently convinced my wife that Keto is for life for me and that she needs to understand that hitting my goal weight does not let me eat like her. (She's never been less than 120lbs or more than 130lbs in 8 years).

Anyway I've been 180lbs as an adult at \~26yo with abs etc but now at 34 i think 190 would be an amazing GW. I'm training in home gym &amp; working out 5 to 6 days per week. That leaves me 30lbs to go and i'm hoping to do that before my 35th birthday in September. 

I'll take some body photos tomorrow for accountability &amp; link them in. I'll also try do some measurements as i'm aware that during my recent stall because I've been training there is probably some muscle being added.  

Thanks",1

3018,"Almost done with week 3 of keto, this is my second time ever doing it. I did it for the first time last year (Jan 2019) for about 4 months, saw great results, felt really good both physically and mentally, and lost about 30lbs.

Started it up again this time around since I've put some chub back on, nothing crazy but I'd like to do it for at least 2 months to lean back out. But it's been a little different since last year.

I remember dealing with the ""keto flu"", both the first and this time that I've done the diet. Really only suffered for the first 2-4 days. By the end of week one I was feeling good, energized, sharp minded, etc. I've been supplementing with magnesium (~500-750mg) and potassium (~200-500mg) almost daily, eating plenty of pink Himalayan salt, started eating at my BMR of 1937 cal., have now decreased to about 1700-1800 cal. daily, &lt;20g net carbs, and drinking between 3-5 liters of water every day. I am now currently suffering from some headaches.

Not exactly sure why this is happening. It's not every day, but more often then not. I even thought the magnesium was causing it, because I was suffering from diarrhea, leading to dehydration, thinking that's what caused my headaches. Cut back on the magnesium, headaches still seem to happen. I'm also now dealing with some mild constipation, I seem to only go #2 right after a bulletproof coffee (1 tbsp MCT, 1-2 tbsp ghee).

Any tips/advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for hearing me out!

I think some minimal ingredient modifications to this guy's recipes would make a lot of those dishes compliant for our keto lifestyle - soy sauce, sugar and the flour reduced or substituted.

I strength train (weighted calisthenics at the minute - UK still in lockdown)
I use Lo salt and have a multivit each day
I walk for an hour or.more most days
I run or cycle twice a week
I sleep between 7-9 hours a night

3023,"**Disclaimer**: in an ideal world we'd get all our protein from food sources like meat, eggs, fish, tofu, black soybeans, etc. This post offers an alternative for anyone who's struggling to do that.

Keto very much works for me. Not eating carbs has largely meant that I don't snack -- which used to be a real problem. However, one or two days a week it works waaaaay too well. As in I am completely unable to eat more than a few bites of eggs, chicken, or fish or pretty much any protein-dense food. The feeling is intense like if I have another bite I'll be ill. Today is one of those days by the way. So I make a very low carb, reasonably low calorie, high protein shake. This is my favorite combo, but you could switch it up with nut milk, frozen raspberries, whatever sounds good.

Not hitting my protein macro (100-120g a day) multiple days a week would be a problem, especially because I'm a woman in my early 50s and am trying to exercise every day with reasonable intensity. Fortunately, over the past 9 months, I've come to recognize those days. Sometimes as soon as when I wake up in the morning. 

I take a scoop of Isopure zero carb unflavored protein powder and a flavored one, usually ON chocolate something or other (3 carbs), put them in the blender, and pour hot or cold coffee over them, mix and either drink warm or pour over ice and drink. If I plan ahead I might even have coffee ice cubes made, in which case the frappuccino taste is pretty amazing. There's nothing magic or special about the ON powder btw. Back before it started tasting too sweet to me I bought a 5-pound barrel of it so I'm trying to use it up. You could use two scoops of the Isopure if you wanted.

Macros on that mix:

Carbs: 3g

Fat: 1g

Protein: 50 g

Calories: 232

So that's the way I get my protein on the ""I can't eat another bite of meat/eggs/cheese,"" days.",1

3026,"Absolutely stoked that I found a diet that works for me and that I enjoy. I contemplated keto for about 2 years but never really knew how to start... after seeing an older coworker lose 60lbs and become no longer diabetic, I figured I’d message him to see how I should go about starting it. 

He told me to clear my shelves of everything and start fresh, and since i live with roommates I couldn’t really do that, however I gave all my pasta and frozen pizza, etc to my roommate and started fresh. 

At first I was eating bacon and eggs in the morning, then chicken drumsticks and broccoli for lunch, or pork chops and broccoli, or steak and asparagus. I was living off that, pretty basic but meeting my targets and keeping my carbs low. I do under 20g net carb keto. 

I’ve always been a huuuge snacker. Love chips, desserts, anything unhealthy. I could eat two family size bags of chips in a night, I got to a point where I was eating a whole package of Oreos in a night... it got bad. 

I’ve tried diets in the past but they’ve just sucked and didn’t taste good and were way too reatrictive, ie Isagenix. 

With keto it’s great, now that im further into it, I’m getting more creative with my meals, I’ve got all my keto replacements for like sauces, stevia sweetened BBQ sauce, seasonings, keto bars, sugar free drinks, etc. (I discovered celery root French fries the other day, and that’s a game changer.) I don’t find keto hard anymore because I still get to eat absolutely delicious meals. (Although I do get the odd craving for Doritos, but pull through it lol)

I have people telling me how much they notice in what I’ve lost off my belly and my face and it’s super wicked having that acknowledgement. 

If you’re just starting out, first week or two, stick with it, remember why you started! It’s absolutely worth it and results are proven! Stay strong through those cravings.

***IMPORTANT TIP TO HELP AVOID KETO FLU*** have a Gatorade zero each day to maintain your electrolytes when you start keto and have them every so often after a few weeks. I’m not saying this is going to avoid keto flu entirely, but that’s a tip I was given and it worked for me. 

My girlfriend will be starting keto soon and I’m so stoked for her!

3027,"Hi all,

So I started keto about 4 weeks ago. 2 weeks ago I confirmed I was in ketosis via blood sample. I feel great! I dropped 0.8kg (1.7lbs) in 2-3 weeks. Bare in mind that when I have previously lost weight, all I have to do is try, and the kgs come off me.
Here's my stats....
Female, 26 years old. Desk job. Work out 30 mins 5 days a week. Walk 10,000-13,000 steps a day. Vegetarian (+white fish).
Weight: 62.7kg // 138.2lbs 
Height: 165cm // 5""5
Calories eating per day currently: 1572-1672
Maintenance calories: 1750 (as told by nutritonist last year) or 1665 (Garmin smart watch tells me this)
20g net carbs // 98g protein // 122g fat
I always stay on my carb goal. Sometimes meet protein goal. Usually go over fat goal by 10-30g. 

I understand I'm not overweight but I just don't understand how the weight isn't falling off me when I am in deficit and in ketosis!

I'm doing my best with tracking everything I consume, down to a sugar free stick of gum, or a single french fry my son desperately wanted to feed to me (he loves french fries). Sometimes I feel like I'm failing at this. I'm a little over a month in, and I've noticed that my carb intake is slowly climbing higher each week. I feel I've become a little careless, and occasionally get carried away. Maybe it's just old habits creeping back up on me but if I want a snack, I'll get a scoop of peanut butter or something, and next thing I know my wife is fighting me trying to take it away. I guess I should try to avoid the snacking. I had a really unhealthy relationship with food in the past, and I'm trying to change that by doing this, as well as be a healthier girl.

Idk what I came here for. Maybe words of wisdom? Encouragement? Inspiration? Just looking for a bit of support I guess.",1
3409,"For those of you using the carb manager app do you factor in your exercise so that it subtracts carbs and calories? Mine draws info from my Apple Watch and does it automatically. Just wondering if anyone else uses this and if you think it’s accurate?

I get that it would subtract calories because calories eaten and calories burned are equivalent but it also subtracts net carbs...how would it know how many carbs I’ve burned off?",1

3411,"Hey all, this is my second time trying strict keto. First time I started at around 190ish and went down to 180 in two weeks. I was thrilled. I kept at it a few extra weeks and didn’t lose any more weight. I felt pretty decent though since my muscles showed again and the ugly fat was disappearing. I then went on vacation in July and of course could not stick to keto. Eventually when I stopped my weight skyrocketed to 203 and after months and intense working out with 0 pounds down, I decided to do strict keto again.

It’s been 3 weeks and I’ve only lost 6 pounds. I’m at 197. Is it normal not to lose weight as fast or as much? Is stalling a thing? Or do some people just not lose much weight after a while? I’m genuinely curious.

I’m at the point now where I want to throw up at the thought of eating anymore eggs, bacon, chicken or beef. I don’t like keto almond cakes, they just don’t hit the spot so it’s not worth the effort for me. I’m confused about the vegetables I’m allowed to eat and how much. I don’t have much energy for weightlifting unless I eat right before (when I’m not on keto I have lots more energy for heavy weights. Had to reduce the weight because I was in pain with the same weight once I was in keto). Any ideas/suggestions?

Keto is the only way I lose weight besides literal starvation which I don’t wana do again.

I am genuinely wanting to learn more, please don’t take this as an attack on keto as I know some can be very ruthless with responses/ OP can get banned if that is the impression.

Thank you for any advice!",1
3412,"I went from 240ish to now 205. A little bit looks different but I don’t see a big change. I measured my waist and stomach it’s still 44 inches, pants still fit tight ( slightly loser then before) my muscles are still here when I flex so it can’t be that.

So how come the scale says 35 pounds down but I don’t look feel or measure different",1
3413,"I'm totally stoked! That's 26.6 LBs down from where I started in just 3 months!!

My starting point was February 1, 2020, where I officially weighed myself at 301.2 LBs. As of today, 3 months and a few days later, I'm nearly 30 LBs less! Depression's been a little hard to combat in the last month because I can't go outside as much due to the virus, but I still lost at least 6 LBs since my last weigh in on April 10th!

I've always struggled with weight loss. Carbs and lack of motivation were two factors that contributed to my continuous weight gain. It wasn't until some stuff happened in my personal life that I finally decided it was time to push myself beyond limitations and improve the quality of my life..

And so, I weened myself away from carbs, away from sweets, junk foods like chips and dip, from soda, and have added more beneficial healthy foods to my diet that are full of nutrients and the vitamins I need. More iced water, tea, morning coffee (with very little creamer), and unsweetened almond milk. Other foods in my diet have contributed to replacements for something I loved, like spaghetti squash rather than noodles.

My goal weight is currently 170 LBs or less by next June, or whenever my boyfriend is moving to the USA. I've given myself a (strict) time limit to reach that goal, whichever scenario happens first.

I do perform minimal exercises because I get anxious trying to exercise around other people, even those that I live with, but I'm going to try to go out of my comfort zone this month and forward to continue pursuing the journey for better health benefits. I'm going to keep going, and I think I'll be posting up monthly updates here with any diet complications/milestones, exercising things, and more that I encounter. I think I could be losing more weight, or could have gone harder since the beginning to weigh less at this point, but this is at least something for now, and I'm hella proud of myself for doing it and sticking to it.

Gosh it feels so freaking good to fit back into some old clothes, too.

I came across [this article](https://lifespa.com/ketogenic-diet-ayurvedic-perspective/) from Dr. John Douillard. As per his post he doesn't recommend Keto for long term and in his article he states why.

Has anyone done Keto for long? If so how was your experience ?",1
3422,"\[I am 18, female, 5ft 4in and weigh 226 pounds\]

Hello everybody! Still very new to the concept of dieting, especially in regards to the Keto diet. I have a lot of doubt when it comes to dieting, and have a lot of difficulty trusting information from sources that are trying to sell me on a specific diet, even if I cross reference information. I find it easier to trust information I've received from real people who have made tangible progress, which is why I'm asking for help rather than stumbling down a rabbit hole of inane keto fad articles. This is only my second day on Keto, and I'm realizing I want to cut my calories back and get some feedback on my macros.

I've been trying to consume under 1,200 calories each day, but I feel like I could go even less, would it be unwise to try to stay at roughly 1,000 calories a day instead?

In regards to macros, I've been trying to consume fats and protein at a very rough ratio of 3:1, all while keeping my carbs under 20g. I think on a daily basis I can get about 80-100g fat, and 40-60g protein. Based on your own experience and knowledge, will these ranges get me into ketosis? Is there anything I can do to speed up the process or lose weight on a faster curb?

(On a small side note, although it may sound disgusting, I'm curious if eating a tbsp of raw olive oil is technically a feasible method of bringing my grams of fat up?)",1

3424,"Hi everyone, very happy to have found this subreddit. Now that we're in lockdown I thought to myself, this is the perfect situation to start a lifestyle change and form a healthy eating habit before I go back to the office in a month. My only regret is that I didn't start sooner! 

I've tried keto a few years back and found it too restrictive, so I fell off the wagon. This time I researched my options more and found some good recipes, and I meal prepped my entire week with a variety of foods. I think this is key and I'm still feeling good about it on day 3 - some headaches and fatigue but I'm powering through. 

I'd like to lose about 25lbs, which was my primary reason for starting. I gained 40lbs during my pregnancy 2 years ago and only lost 15, then life got in the way - I've always felt a bit unhappy about this and I want to make a change, and if we decide to add another little one in the next year or two I want to make sure I'm back at my goal weight and healthy first. 

Something else I've considered is that I'm hoping keto can give me some mental health benefits. Has this been true for you at all? Anxiety is a big struggle for me- life changes and social situations are big triggers for me. I do a lot of overthinking and ruminating. I see a therapist once a week for accountability and I'm trying CBT techniques, but she thinks my anxiety sounds chemically-influenced and advised that I visit with a doctor about antidepressants. 

I'm not really comfortable taking medication, so I'm wondering if this diet can positively affect brain chemistry and wellbeing - other than the obvious weight loss confidence boost. What's your experience been? 

Many thanks!",1

3428,"i'm curious to hear from other former sugar addicts, how did you guys break the spell and stay keto? did you go cold turkey, or wean yourself off? how long did it take for cravings to go away? was there some point where you had to put your foot down and be like 'i just need to hold off!' or was it more of an internal process where you became disgusted by what sugar does and therefore you no longer place value on it, and without value, there's no desire to consume it?

&amp;#x200B;

ive been reading Atomic Habits and it talks about the cycle of cue&gt;craving&gt;response&gt;reward so im trying to reverse engineer it. maybe the cue could be, you see your coworker eating a candy bar on lunch, or a customer has something sugary or junk foody. you have a craving which is probably something along the lines of 'oh, that looks good' or 'i want to have some too, so i don't stand out from all my coworkers'. the response is either that you resist the urge (but might have intrusive thoughts/back and forth trying to justify it, or anxiety that you can't have something pleasurable) or you give in for the short term pleasure and relief. the reward is immediate when you give in, which makes it so much more appealing in general and even when we are coming from this position of mental clarity and strength like ""i will NEVER eat sugar again!"" the next thing you know, you're checking out with a bag of m&amp;ms.

&amp;#x200B;

from my experience, there was a process that looked something like this:

0 (pre) i actually shifted my limiting beliefs about myself, i used to think ""oh, im just the type of guy who eats a whole ass little ceasars pizza on friday nights and loves Baja Blast. I could never give that up, that wouldn't be ""me""."" and then i suspended that belief and started to think ""or maybe if i do the other thing, i could become the other guy. you know, the one i actually want to be.""

&amp;#x200B;

1. cut back slowly on soda, i would allow myself a soda 50% of the time, then 1 in 3 visits to the gas station, then switched to diet. and at 
2. started small by eating a 'healthy' meal and no snacks after dinner (at the time it was typical brown rice, chicken breast, broccoli)
3. get more excited about how efficient the fat burning of keto seemed, i got excited to get meal prep containers and learn new recipes, i saw a value in saving money and time by cutting back on snacks and extras  and limiting my diet to whole foods (basically just meat and veg) at this point i switched from 'healthy carbs' to strict keto (i didn't count veggie carbs but i legit just ate meat, broccoli or brussels sprouts, keto salad, peanut butter and chocolate protein for like 2 years.)
4. the habit shift was almost immediate and i didnt really struggle with cravings or FOMO at all, and i really believe it was a combination of the VALUE part (looking at sugar as poison, looking at keto as powerful and interesting) mixed with IDENTITY (having a lifestyle, not a diet) which sort of supercharged my ability to overcome what had previously been binge-eating, sugar addiction, eating 5 servings of chicken nuggets and two quesadillas for dinner then snacking on two pb&amp;j two hours later, etc.pretty incredible jump from one exreme to the next.

so im curious what worked for others?",1
3429,"I re-started keto yesterday (tried it for a week earlier this year) and day 1 was going well until it took 2.5 hrs for my keto bowl from chipotle to arrive via DoorDash.

3834,"Hi everyone, I was recently diagnosed as pre/diabetic with an A1c of 6.4. I've been tracking with a glucose monitor to try and figure out what's going on, as I'm young, healthy BMI, and active. I think this all comes down to carb tolerance, which I confirmed last night with my glucose meter; having three tacos spiked my BG to 165 an hour after dinner. 

I've decided to commit to keto (rather than simply low-carb, which wasn't helping), starting simply with bacon/eggs/salmon/avocado (kind of a fat fast, I guess?) until things level out and I figure out what I can tolerate. I just started metformin, but I'm hoping combining medication + keto + IF can help me lower my numbers once and for all.

My doctor wasn't super helpful or optimistic that keto would be helpful, and he didn't provide a lot of guidance as far as what glucose numbers I should shoot for when I check. But I'm worried about how much my glucose is spiking after a meal with \~2 net carbs! About an hour ago, I broke a 20-hour fast with salmon, bacon, and avocado with plenty of olive oil. But my blood sugar is 133! This morning, it was 86, so this seems like a pretty significant spike. Is this normal? Should I expect the spikes to eventually minimize after I stay on keto for awhile?

I can't seem to draw any connection to my energy levels and what I've eaten other than the last couple of days I've gone way over on my protein intake,

Maybe I'm not getting enough electrolytes?

My one guilty habit is an orange and a piece of mint dark choc in the evenings (around 2 hours before bed) but I can't see that being a problem. One thing I have noticed is that my sleep has changed and I wake up earlier than my alarm but I thought that was a good thing.

I wanted to share the discoveries I made over time to other fellow Canadian ketoers. Some, but not all, of these are available in other countries as well.

So here's my list, in no particular order:

---
### Buster Rhino's Pork Rinds

If you ever tried pork rinds from the grocery, trust me, these are completely different and way better. They have a very different texture that's both airy and crispy, and the flavours are simply amazing. They currently have 15 (!) different flavours to choose from, and they rotate them pretty frequently, so there are always new ones to discover.

**Macros:** 6g fat / 11g protein / 1g net carb per 20g serving

---
### Sweet Nutrition Soft Baked Cookies

These don't have the shape and texture of traditional soft-baked cookies, so the name is a little misleading, but these are very good, and you'd probably never guess they're a low-carb snack if you weren't told. They're sweetened with erythritol and stevia (no maltitol) and contain MCT oil. All 3 flavours are good so I suggest getting the variety pack.

### Blue Diamond Bold Habanero BBQ Almonds

While I like nuts in general, they can become a little boring to eat after a while, so I like to buy flavoured nuts to spice things a little (no pun intended). These are the best ones I've tried. They have _a lot_ of seasoning (they aren't called ""bold"" for nothing), and have just the right balance of sweet and spicy. These are also sometimes called ""Zesty BBQ"" instead of ""Habanero BBQ"", but it's the exact same flavour.

### Lily's Creamy Milk Chocolate

This chocolate bar has the taste and texture of regular milk chocolate bars, but it's only sweetened with ""good"" sweeteners. Unlike low-carb chocolate bars frequently found at grocery stores, these contain no maltitol, meaning they have a low glycemic index and won't result in digestive issues. It's sweetened with erythritol and stevia.

**Macros:** 10g fat / 2g protein / 2g net carb per 30g serving

### Chocorite Peanut Butter Patties

These are the best-tasting alternative to Reese's peanut butter cups that I've found that contain no maltitol. They contain a lot of fiber additives, so these aren't exactly nutritious, but they satisfy that peanut butter cup craving very effectively. Sweetened with erythritol and sucralose.

**Where to buy:** Online low-carb groceries

**Macros:** 7g fat / 2g protein / 1g net carb per 36g serving

### Quest Snack Bars

These are a more recent, lesser-known alternative to regular Quest bars. While regular Quest bars are mainly made out of whey protein and insoluble fiber (isomalto-oligosaccharides), these contain ""cleaner"" ingredients and are a lot easier to digest. They are made primarily out of nuts (almonds, peanuts, pistachios). They have a relatively high net carb count for a keto snack, so eat with moderation.

**Where to buy:** Supplement stores

**Macros:** 15g fat / 10g protein / 5g net carb per 43g bar

### Cello Whisps

These are crisps made entirely of cheese. That's right, they're not cheese-flavoured crisps, they're 100% cheese. They taste delicious alone (eaten like chips) or in salads. Other brands offer similar crisps (Moon Cheese, ParmCrisps, Just The Cheese, Groksi), but I'm mainly buying Whisps because they're available at Costco, which makes them significantly cheaper.

### Fat Snax Brownie Bites

These are a great keto option for two-bite brownie lovers. They're offered in two flavours (brownie and blondie, both are great), they're soft and moist, and they contain _zero_ net carbs, which is pretty impressive for a sweet treat. These are sweetened with xylitol and stevia and contain no maltitol. I tried the cookies from the same brand and haven't been impressed, so I suggest sticking to their brownies.

3846,"So my kitten died on 24th and I have been unintentionally doing IF since then (loss of appetite). 20:4, 18:6, 23:1 variation till 3rd of May. In the meantime I was researching about IF and stumbled upon videos of Dr Sten Ekberg, Dr Eric Berg, Dr Mindy Plez and a few other people who talk about keto and have been doing keto for the last two days. Not only my hunger subsided, I am not feeling depressed anymore (I have been extremely stressed and depressed since my kitten died) and for the first time in 2 weeks, I feel euphoric, as if I am on ecstasy.

Not only that, I have been practising handstand for quite sometime now, and today  I could not just hold it for a good amount of time but I am pretty satisfied with my form. I also noticed I was doing boxer shuffle jump roping for 10+ min straight and I was not slightly bit tired.

Are all of these supposed to happen?",1
3847,"Hi guys. Just want to take a minute to express my gratitude for all the info/support/love yall spread on here. I'm a runner who's always struggled with my weight. My last marathon was Grandma's Marathon in 2017. I was 250 and training for that marathon  destroyed my body. On top of that the marathon beat the hell out of me. My goal was 4 ½ hours and I ended up walking nearly half the race. Humbled me so bad I stopped running for nearly 3 years. Gained a bunch of weight, wife and I had a kid last December and dark circles under my eyes aside, I just didnt like who I saw in the mirror. I was weighing in at 264 and I just looked unhappy. 

Jan 5th this year I took things back into my own hands. I started living keto again (I've done it with great success several times in my life) and while I didnt start running again immediately; as the weight started to come off I felt the fire coming back. I've been running consistently again for about a month and I'm proud to say today is 4 months into my journey and I'm down 40lbs and feeling great. On Jan 5th I was 264lbs and today, May 5th I'm down to a lean and mean 224. I feel better than I've felt in a long time. I've decided I want another shot at Grandmas marathon in 2021 and have made the commitment to myself to go back and get my revenge. 

Thank you for the support and guidance. Whether you know it or not YOU are a big part of my journey and I am grateful.",1

Im 22 and i just started doing keto 
I already been doing intermitting fasting for 16 hours a day and trying as i could to stay on a calories defficit 
Recently with the intermitting fasting and the calories defficit i started doing keto( but i changed the micros a bit  with 65%fat 10% carbs and 25%protien )
So my question is with these micros am i still in ketosis or( gonna enter ketosis ) ?
And is doing the fasting , calories defficit and keto all at once gonna help me lose weight faster ?",1
3850,"Tl;dr at the end.

So a while ago. I posted about training for the wildland fire pack test. 3 miles in 45 mins carrying 45 lbs at a walk. I had been training the last 2 weeks with a 24lb pack. It wasn't terrible. Lol. But I could definitely feel the work. A little info for context; To date, I have drop 50 lbs. Yay me! Carrying half that weight was work, but keep reading to see how it really hit me.

So as I approached the training for the pack test, I thought 45 will be easy. I was carrying it around before as extra fat. And before the gym closed, I was squatting the 45lb bar. I was benching 80 lbs. Deadlifting 80 lbs. Totally killing the toning and firming of my body. So I started with the 24 lb pack. And it was fine. The configuration was weird, but I was able to get it done. 3 miles in 47 mins with the 24lbs. I was telling my sister how good it seemed to be strengthening my back and core. You need very correct posture otherwise it's killer on your shoulders and back. She said she wanted to try it, so I took her the 24lb pack (it belongs to my brother). I have access to the fire packs at work, so I would be able to keep training.

So yesterday. Yesterday I put on the 45lb pack. 5 lbs less than the amount of weight I've lost. And O.M.G! I was only able to complete a mile before I had to take it off! My breathing was labored, my back was struggling not to collapse, and every step was torture. This morning, my back and core are sore from supporting the weight. I have a lot of work to do to be able to complete this pack test. I don't know how non-fire militia like myself, complete it every year without training! 

So the point of my story. When you get to the point where feel like you've accomplished nothing or have stalled and you're ready to just give up or find that denying yourself the cake is too torturous, find yourself the weight you've lost and wear it for 30 minutes. It's a great reminder of why you are doing what your are doing. It shows you in real time where you were. Even if its half the weight you've lost, do it and see how good taking it off makes you feel.

I can't believe my body was carrying around that much extra weight. Somedays it's difficult to see that there is still that much weight to come off to hit my goal. But it definitely gave me a perspective I would have never guessed would straighten my track even more. 

Tl;dr - after 50lbs of weight loss, I thought carrying 45 lbs  for 3miles would be a cake walk.",1
3851,"It's my 18th day of keto but only very recently I realised that I am not having enough protein. When I calculated, I should be having 91g protein, 20g carbs, and 60g fat with total of 982 calories. Whatever I try to do, my protein intake is averaging at 45 while I hit 60g fat and under the calorie limit. For the last 9days, I have no change in scale nor weight. What can I do? Should I restart after taking a 36 hour fast or continue. Am worried that my metabolism is affected too. I also read that keto doesn't work for some people. Would I be like that? Should I give it up? Please do help me out.",1
3852,"Keto is not that known in my country (Spain) and when I talk to my friends about my journey almost every time I have to explain the whole thing, the ketosis, what I can eat, what I can't, why I'm doing this, etc. Most of the time people are curious and I like explaining it so I'm ok with the questions. The problem comes when some people, that I know have ZERO knowledge about nutrition, start with the ""that doesn't sound healthy"" ""you have to have fruit"" ""you shouldn't eat that amount of meat"". I know that they mean well in some way but they never told me to my face, when I had a BMI of 35, that my diet wasn't healthy. Sure I could eat fruit back then, I would have one piece every couple days, and then I was eating like garbage.

I get that keto sounds extreme when you start to put in a list everything you can't have, but don't give unsolicited advice if you have no idea what a macro is to begin with. Most days I eat some meat with a side of veggies, that's not extreme, and that's the base of my diet. 

I hate that you can starve yourself eating salads and that's ok, but God forgive if I put cheese on my meals and I don't have an apple every day.

When you see someone having a healthy relationship with food for the first time in their life, even if that comes with some type of restrictions, you shouldn't give your uninformed opinion, I do keto for weight loss, but I'm almost at my goal weight and I'll keep doing keto for health reasons, I suffer from PCOS and keto has helped immensely with this disease.

Worst part of keto is people who have no idea what keto is, because literally I just explained it to them, and they decide, it's not good for me, well, go eat your pasta, I'll be here getting healthier and happier.

I'm 22kg (48lbs) down in 6 months, and I'm only 156cm (5'1) so that's a big deal. KCKO.",1
3853,"

I've just started Keto 3 weeks ago, so far so good! 

In 2 weeks I'm going on a 2 day mountain bike trip: 60km on Saturday which will take us about 7 hours including stops and a bit of sight seeing, and about 50km on Sunday (3 hours) 
I'm fit and used to long rides, I go out twice a week and ride between 30/50k, so the distance is not going to be an issue.

The area is remote so we need to bring our own lunch and snacks for Saturday. Dinner is provided for ( not keto but I'll just skip the rice).

What would you recommend that I take with me?
To make things a little more complicated: I live in SE Asia and the temperature is about 35 degrees C when we go. Furthermore, I don't have access to most prepacked keto food so will have to make things from scratch, which is fine.
Edit: I prefer vegetarian food, but small amounts of fish and meet are ok.
And last but not least: volume, it can't be too heavy and bulky.
Suggestions for a good breakfast are welcome too! 

Thanks in advance!",1

This experience has helped me decide that i need to watch labels closer and dont trust when the nutrition facts state something is 0 Carbs. I need to meal plan in advance. Im more likely to go over my carb limit if i cook insteak of stick to my KetoChow.

4286,"Hi all

Does anybody know of a certification program that specifically looks at the nutritional aspects of addressing mental health issues?  I’m in the process of becoming a psychotherapist and would like a reasonably credible program to be able to discuss keto from a mental health perspective. Something like a CE course would be fine, or even something different altogether different. 

I’ve seen Dr Leslie Korns program which is a CE course for therapists, and also a PhD in integrative and functional nutrition at saybrook university but that will take 4 years at least. Obviously these options are at opposite ends of the spectrum. I’ve also considered becoming a Nutritional Therapy Practitioner, and am curious if anyone had tried this. 

(for background I have a degree in biochemistry and biomedical sciences already, so I’m cool with science)

Any advice or ideas are appreciated.",1
4287,"I know it sounds like a contradictory title! I am trying to dive back into keto. One of my biggest issues is my sweet tooth. I love sweets, and I know there are tons of keto desserts all over pinterest. However, I'm trying to improve my health overall, and I try to eat as clean as possible. I've had plenty of artificial sweeteners in the past, but I am trying to eliminate things like that. My rule of thumb has been to try to eliminate anything not found in nature, or anything that I can't explain what's in it or how they make it. Maybe I sound a little crazy lol. 

Anyway, my question is: have you found any natural way to sweeten different foods or baked goods? I was thinking maybe pureed strawberries or bananas? I know that would raise net carbs, but if it was a very small amount it should be manageable. Thanks!",1

I am doing keto more then 6 month
In last 6 month I rarely had 25g of carb mostly I was under 20g of carb.
Is 6 month enough for our body to be fat adopted if yes then can I have more then 20 g of carb and be still ketoses . I will not go over 35g.
My second question is not related to keto but related to exercise 
I do cardio and run so every day I burn 300 to 500calories . Why it don’t help with weight lose ?
Where all our exercise goes?
For instance my macros is 1200 calories so if I am burning 500 calories every day then why I am not losing faster ?
I always got great advices here just wanted to know any idea about exercise that we do.
Be safe

I sleep decently on most days and I wake up awake, then give it an hour or two and I'm ready for a nap. Then, when I take a nap I'm good for an hour or two and ready to take another. And still can sleep at night. I'd say narcolepsy, but it takes me a bit longer than 10 minutes to fall asleep.

SO... I looked up the CFS diet and it said basically whole grains in form of barley, quinoa, and brown rice, but to get carbs from fruits and vegetables. And stay low carb. Eat healthy fats, little to no red meat, and plenty of lean meats. I'm thinking Keto would be a good diet/lifestyle to do then. Will be asking doc next week as well, but curious if someone with CFS has had more energy and less tiredness with Keto?",1
4295,"My family had been aware of my weight loss journey since close to the beginning as I saw them infrequently enough that each time was a staggering difference. What they didn't know was exactly how I was losing the weight. Granted, I told them the truth when I said I was being mindful of what I ate, cut out the junk, and stuck to a caloric deficit, but never specifically said the words ""keto"" or what exactly I was avoiding.

My grandmother and grandfather caught on quicker than everyone else that I was watching my carb intake almost specifically because my grandmother is diabetic and does pretty much the same. They were the first I told and spent many months afterward sharing recipes and checking in.

I kept mostly silent with my immediate family, though, as they weren't really keen on the idea of keto. They didn't understand it or thought it was silly. Some ridiculous crash course diet fad, you know? So the last thing I wanted was to face scrutiny or be the butt of jokes because I didn't want to eat bread. These have been my experiences in the past when attempting to make lifestyle changes that varied from their own.

But I had a genuinely sweet conversation with my dad the other day over the phone. He was telling me about how he and my siblings had some new takeout place and it was absolutely delicious. I said that sounded so good and that I'd find a recipe to try.

He made the affirming comment about how I can't have pasta, sugar, and rice right and asked what I could have instead. I told him I'd simply use zoodles and cauliflower rice. We then talked a bit more about alterations to the recipes and how he thought I would love it because of all the veggies involved.

When we gave our farewells and hung up the phone I was left feeling so . . . happy? Validated? Some weird, sweet, mushy combination of emotions that don't make sense! I never expected that out of my dad's mouth and I'm still smiling about it.

4301,"Hey guys, I'm still fairly new to keto, I started on February 29th this year! I'm posting this for anyone brand new or who thinks they cannot do this because they lack the ability to exercise because of a disability or physical issues.
I'm down 24 pounds in 9 weeks from counting carbs and zero exercise. My starting weight was 293 and I'm down to 269. It's not that I don't want to exercise, I had a major back surgery to correct a birth defect and my L5-S1 are fused together with a cage and rods and all kinds of lovely contraptions. I'm only 5'6 and I've got a lot of weight on me and I don't want to exercise and make myself miserable until I get down closer to 220. Even then I'll mostly be doing light walking. It's shameful to know you're so big and physically you can't even walk without putting so much pressure on your joints that you end up paying for that little bit of exercising in the long run. For those that deal with this you know it comes down to mapping out shopping trips so you take the least amount of steps, planning outings around whether you can do what everyone else wants to do. Pain is no joke, especially when it's with every step you take. I take no prescribed pain medicine, however I do live on ibuprofen. I can tell a huge difference on my knees and back just losing the 24 pounds. The amount of energy I actually have is unreal. A few times I've gotten on a stationary bike and was able to exercise a bit without it being excruciating, and I didn't suffer for days afterward either. Huge huge improvement. The biggest thing I've noticed about this diet is mood stabilization. I have no mood swings whatsoever. I was also taking high doses of Metformin just to get my blood sugar down, then I'd have low blood sugar and have to carry glucose tablets just in case. After 2 weeks of keto I was able to stop the Metformin and not 1 time has my blood sugar dropped. Not once! Plus all of my blood sugar readings have been perfect. By week 8 all my labs were normal. My cholesterol, blood sugar, liver, and thyroid are all fine now compared to the wreck they were. My doctor cannot believe it. She wanted to put me on 3 more medications in January and by the end of April I need ZERO medications.
This diet has turned into a way of life. My biggest issue was cooking, I'm a tv dinner and snack kind of gal. Now I plan my meals, cook them, and meal prep. I had the withdrawal flu the first 3 days I started keto and a headache for almost a week but now there are zero cravings. The most important lesson I've learned that you eat to live, not live to eat. I'm the most yo yo diet, give up and give in person that I know. You couldn't pay me money to go back to the way that I felt compared to the brand new human I feel like now. There is actually hope, and as you lose the weight you start to believe in yourself and gain confidence. I'm glad I found this group, it's been nice reading your posts and seeing your pictures. For anyone new that thinks you can't do this, especially with physical limitations, trust me when I say YES YOU CAN!!!",1
4302,"Hi everyone, I'm looking for advice :)

(I'm french so, sorry for my english)

**Short version :**

As I wrote, I'm on keto for one year now, and I am still constipated even if I have try so many stuff :

* Magnesium and potassium complement (and also omega 3) : I still take this. When I take it for the first I had a super good digestion just for one day, after it's came back constipated as always, but not yellow anymore lol. Before that I thinks my kidney was really in deficiency, so after these complement I had a more normal color of poop (sorry for the detail)
* I have tried only carnivore diet but I take weight a this period (6 month approximately?).. Now, (after a 11 days fasting) I eat way more vegetables and that change nothing lol (on my digestion, I feel better in general otherwise)
* I do sport almost everyday, intensive training (15/20min a day) for one month I thinks ?
* I have a little pot (?) on toilet to put my leg upper, thats help but still constipated.
* I have start the warrior fasting one month ago (I'm eating on 4 hours every day).
* For 2 or 3 week I take as break of my fast, fermented milk. Same, it's help me for like 2/3 days and now it's back the same T\_T
* I have take too three different probiotic. I am still taking one now.

**Also, imortant : I'm autistic. And I'm aware that autistic people have a super bad digestion in general and that's my case.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Long version : To explain more my way**

I have been vegan to my 14 to 18 years old. My digestion was not super good but I was not constipated that much. I was more on diarrhea side but not extreme. Before the veganisme I also have bad digestion, but it was changing depending on period. After that, I have take antidepressant and it was a suuuuper bad idea. I had a lot of defiency, have a lot of eating disorders, I have take a loooot of weight (I am still fighting to lose it) because of that.   
I was not able to be vegan at all. After one year of that shit I stop it and start taking oil and vitamins complement, that's help me so much. I thinks 40% of my eating disorders where gone just by taking those. I also learnd to don't feel bad for eating, to give me time and to listen to my gut a lot.

After couple of month that, I have done a one week fasting, that heal me so many things.  
I think the medication kill my digestion, because I was all the time having stomach acid (fortunately the fasting heal that) and constipation or extreme diarrhea.

A bad things I have start to do  though : lots of anal enema during aproximatively a year. I don't know how much it's killed my digestion, but now I don't do it anymore.

6 month after, I have start keto diet (and I was before that reducing carb without notice it)

After 6 month I have start eating super carnivore, but not in a super healthy way. I do a trip in another country and it was great but I was super super alone so I fall a little back in depression. I had some bad time eating lot of chocolate and sweety things. I thinks this bad diet (a lot a fat and prot and some time ""chocolate crisis"") last 4 months. I was also eating a lot, because I was so depress :/  
It's at this period that I have start magnesium and potassium. As I said, this healed my kidney a lot.

After that, I have done a 11 days fasting and now I'm eating so much better, I love vegetables, I'm not attract at all by kinder bueno or others stuff \^\^ Well, if someone give me one I will eat it for sure, but I don't need to go to the supermarket buy like one hundred of these.

I have also start the sport couple of week before my fatsing. I was at first only capable to do easy stuff every other day, but now I'm able to do it almost every day, I'm super proud ✨

But I still have this fucking constipation and bad digestion !! I have no idea what to do more :/

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I don't see myself eating carb again. Apart the constipation stuff, I feel pretty great, stronger than I was, able to do sport, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

What I eat in general : The fermented milk and/or kefir yogurt ; after waiting like one hour : in general mushroom, avocado, onion, a quarter of tomato, salad (green) and meet. It's beef, but thats can change. Ham, and goat cheese too, also county cheese (I have this is France, I don't know if you have that too lol, it's from cow milk howewer).  
As a snack, I take nature yogurt with a little spoon of peanut butter and a square of 90% chocolate. Before my 11 days fats I was not eating peanut butter but now I'm attracted by it, so I thinks I must need it :)

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I thinks I have say everythings, I hope someone have an idea of what I can try, thanks in advance and I wish you good luck for the confinement :)",1
4303,"Hi everyone,

In a month I'll be 21 years old, I'm 5'4"" and just broke 140 lbs, which is the most I've ever weighed. All throughout middle and high school I was 130 lbs. Then, during college, I found myself gaining weight, even though I wasn't eating any differently (I live at home, so by avoiding the cafeteria food, I shouldn't have really been susceptible to the freshman fifteen). I tried a personal trainer and going to the gym 3x a week, but being so exhausted after working out in the morning, I would overeat for energy, and I was still the same size as before, maybe a pound or so less \[yes, I know, by working out I was ideally replacing fat with muscle, so I shouldn't look at the number, but I was still carrying fat\].

Then, my Dad comes home from an extended retreat in our TN cabin so he could transform his diet. Formerly 307 lbs, he hit his goal of 190 lbs after less than a year by eating a carnivore diet. He introduced me to keto, and I dropped weight from 135 to 125 so fast from cutting carbs I was almost afraid. However, I also saw how by eating carbs and carrying the water weight, I could gain anywhere from 2 to 5 lbs by straying from the program. 

This was a year ago. Since then, my keto journey has had lots of ups and downs, and been very cyclical (between carbing out for one or two weeks when I'm on vacation with friends, around the holidays, or there's a string of birthdays and concerts, and then eliminating all carbs except vegetables). Because of all this volleying back and forth, I started to pro-long my periods when I'm off keto, and then cram all the cards into my body that I can. I've made myself physically sick from eating this way, and even threw up when I binged candy on Halloween. I have a carb addiction. Because I don't live by myself, I have access to them: my Mom stocked up on girl scout cookies before COVID-19, and she always has ice cream and has been baking a bunch of banana bread. I've finally cracked and gave in to eating carbs, rationalizing that everyone is gaining weight during these strange times of self-isolation. But I've gone way past the line of being indulgent - I know because I'll settle for sweets I don't even particularly like to satisfy the craving. 

I love the way that I feel when I'm truly keto. Eating OMAD is perfect for me, and I have the energy to work out. Even keto acceptable foods can trigger my carb addiction - peanut butter is a BIG one. I can eat out of the jar like nobody's business. Though I've seen the benefits of keto, and harm of carbs, there are two big road blocks for me:

1) **Social eating;** my friends all love their carbs (some are suffering from it weight-wise, and others are as thin as can be). While they know about my diet and are accepting (for example, if they order pizza, I get chicken wings for myself), sometimes I just want to join in and have some pizza and ice cream with them. **But then I can't stop.** Or, even when I'm with my friends, I find myself over-eating keto food to compensate (such as snacking on pork rinds when my friends are having chips, just so I don't feel awkward for making them feel awkward about snacking). **How do I overcome this emotional/mental element of insecurity in my diet?** 

2) **I don't know if I'm strong enough to state: I'll never have carbs again**. I certainly need to. I'm clearly addicted. But that thought incites the fear in me today that makes me want to stuff my face. But whenever I come off of keto and indulge in carbs, I always overeat and show no self-restraint. Before my body could tolerate it, but now my binges have been adding up to excess fat on my body that is getting harder and harder to shed and requiring me to be keto for longer periods, which is discouraging when I don't see the results, and causing me to lose heart and go to the pantry. I'm also turning 21 soon and plan to go out and socially drink maybe once a month (I'm studying Accounting, and so happy hour is a big thing). I'm fine with ordering virgin drinks and am not that into alcohol to begin with, but I don't know if I can say: I'll never drink, either.

I know compared to some of the other testimonies in the thread, my weight and struggles seem small. But I feel myself going down a road where five years from now I'll wonder what happened to my body. Please help me prevent the struggle my father and many of you shared - before I was confident I'd never look like him when he was obese, and now I'm not sure. It doesn't help that all my friends call me tiny and make fun of me for being on a diet. 

I guess what I'd appreciate is to hear similar stories of overcoming carb addiction and how you've handled the pitfalls of social eating. I could really use an encouraging community I can report back to with my results and keep me on the right path.

Many thanks,

Gemini Girl",1
4304,"Hi everyone

I’m just wondering if any of you have ocd and have tried keto to help your symptoms? If you have a different mental illness,  please also feel free to share as any experience at all is valid and worthwhile to me :) 

Some studies have been done looking at the role of the ketogenic diet in mental illnesses, as well as the role of inflammation in ocd. They’re all rather inconclusive or positive with no real recommendations  so I’d love to hear if anyone has any experience with both ocd and the ketogenic diet and what your experience was. 

Thank you for anyone who is willing to share!",1
4305,"For the past two weeks, I have been on keto and in the past I have been on and off of keto. Though, this time I want to make a full commitment to do this. I have gave away all of the junk food in my apartment to my mom and sister haha.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Now this part of the post is to just keep track of my progress per se as I go along my journey.**

I'm 23, 5' 10"" Male Currently 212 lbs, 30.5 bmi, 25.8%.

Now there are many reasons I want to do keto-- it's because I have heard of many benefits. I just want to better myself. **And also for a research perspective sake.** Because, I was born with a liver disease and me with my current state is not helping my liver at all. As, if I kept up this lifestyle it would kill me. Though, last time I did keto it was great-- because I lost lots of weight in a month. In that time when I visited my liver doc my liver vitals were actually turning around! Though, thing here is on keto liver is burning fat so that's my only worry.

When I started keto this time around, I was 218 lbs, and I'm currently around 212 with 2 weeks in. My body fat is at 25.8%. My goal weight is around 160-180lbs and around 15%-17% body fat.

My macros are 14g net carbs, 86g fat, 69g protein, and 1100 net calories. Though, I never fully understood macros. I'm just taking this from the carb manager app I had downloaded noted below..

I have downloaded the carb manager app + gotten a BMI weight scale, and now I make full use of my apple watch tracking all my steps / calories burned from workouts. I have also started to workout more and now starting 18/6 intermitted fasting since this isolation has been helping me with that.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

For people that had barriers or in a similar situation. Or how long did it take you to see results? And how did you make it not boring as I think everyday right now I'm making eggs and turkey bacon for breakfast, and tilapia and broccoli salad for dinner... that gets boring after some time I think. For food choices, I'm currently trying to avoid red meat and stick to chicken and sea food + low carb sides.",1
4306,"I’m a 30 year old female who’s struggling with keto. I feel like I’m doing everything right and not losing, and I actually gained weight this week! It’s very demoralizing so I thought I’d come on here for some help. 

I’d previously used keto to lose 30 lbs with no significant exercise last spring-summer. I restarted the diet this spring while in quarantine and did it for a whole month with zero weight loss. I got a little fed up and fell off the wagon but restarted again 2 weeks ago at a weight of 227, height 5’7”. I also started exercising with HIIT (running) 3 times a week and weight lifting (nothing crazy these are like 10-15 lb dumbbells at home). I decided to strictly count macros this time due to my lack of weight loss last month and for me they come out to: 1600 cals, 20g carbs, 124g fat, 100g protein. I used the carb manager app for the macro calculations and use it to keep track of what I eat. Some days I go a tiny bit over in carbs (like 25-30) but this is not usual and mostly I’m at or under 20. I’m hitting all my other macros as well and eating right around 1600 cals. I’ve also been trying to do intermittent fasting with eating only in an 8 hour window. 

Despite all this I GAINED 2 lbs when I weighed myself a few days ago. I thought maybe it was a fluke, or maybe related to gaining some muscle from starting to work out for the first time in forever. But I weighed myself again today and am still 1.8 lbs above where I started :( 

I have no idea what I’m doing wrong and I feel like it’s absolutely insane that I gained weight. My thoughts are: 1) I gained muscle from exercising? I don’t know how likely that is from just running/lifting weights for 30mins a day. I do feel a little skinnier than 2 weeks ago though.  2) Maybe I need to be super strict about staying absolutely under 20 carbs every day? 3) Eating Great Low Carb Bread Company products are throwing me out of ketosis? I’ve never heard of this being a problem for others, but I have been eating their bread for sandwiches and using their pizza crust on occasion.

I recently had my thyroid checked and it was normal. But I’m just not sure how the heck I gained weight given that in addition to eating low carb and exercising, I know I also haven’t been eating a ton of calories. 

Any thoughts you guys have would be appreciated.",1
4307,"Firstly, this is not to demean or be derogatory to anyone with professional medical expertise. I am just trying to share and learn what stigma is associated with the keto diet according to people in the medical/nutritional field. 

Well for me, I've had a dermatologist tell me **keto** is a high protein diet which ***killed two of her doctor friends who tried it***. The whole time I had to clench my fist thinking *I came here for a hair loss appointment Margaret.* Also, I came across a dietician's post which said ***'if keto isn't tough for you, you're probably doing it wrong'.*** LOL Um What? Where were you when I stuffed my face with domino's pizza and milkshakes whenever I fcked up my SAD due to my lack of self control and plummeting energy?  Where were you when I was eating nothing but junk and parading around with a high risk of cardiac arrest/BP/diabetes? Where were you when I cried and failed every goddamn time when I tried a low calorie/ 'balanced' diet? 

The thing that really infuriates me is how literally everyone around me, including my mother, tries to blame keto for being too restrictive - when I love the food and feel so herculean that i've actually started exercising after ages. I have been stalled at 191 pounds though for the past month, but am sure I'll pull through it. KCKO

That said, what's the worst thing you've been told about keto from someone with ***professional medical experience***?",1
4308,"So I have been pretty dedicated to Keto over the past week. It has been difficult adjusting on some counts but I did a good job keeping my carb count to 20-25g a day. Anyways I had the strongest craving for pizza and decided to look up some recipes. I found one on this subreddit, but cannot locate for the past hour so thought I might give my experience.

Basically it uses 1lb ground beef, mixed with a cup of shredded cheese, herbs, and an egg.

After baking that you would then add toppings, I did not know how much was exactly appropriate but I put basically 3/4 cup of tomato sauce (the total carb count on the jar said it was 14g), 1 cup of mozzarella, and 7 slices of pepperoni.

About 30min and a delicious meal later, I am absolutely stuffed. I tend to meticulously track my calories as I am trying to cut fat, but today, after reading so many people writing they don't, I decided I would fill in my macros after the fact. Well surprise surprise, after I log into Cronometer and fill it in, all of a sudden somehow I have consumed 3000kcal worth and about 40g of carbs, mostly from CHEESE (if I adjust for the underreported tomato sauce it comes to approx 50g).

I feel discouraged, almost cheated, I thought keto recipes were carb friendly, especially since I have been so committed to working out every other day, following an OMAD lifestyle and doing a 48 hour fast every other week, this all is pretty discouraging.

I don't necessarily want to break keto, but I am starting to question whether this diet really is for me, as I did enter into it initially for the health benefits and to lose weight (I am Male, 21, Originally 80Kg and 18% body fat, down to 77.2 KG as of this morning, aiming for 65KG or 13% body fat).

I want to hear your feedback on keto recipes one might find on this feed, or if I should be adjusting my lifestyle in some way or if I am doing keto incorrectly somehow. I read somewhere on here not to give into a slippery slope, but if I this counts as me falling out of ketosis then would it be more harmful for me to enjoy things like fruit today that I normally wouldn't?

Sorry for the long post, just feeling discouraged. Also I have already read through the tutorial, FAQ and numerous posts. Thanks again

TL;DR - I'm M/21/Starting 80KG, 18%/NOW 77.2KG/TARGET 65KG or 13%, started keto last week, followed it religiously including a 48 hour fast on the weekend. Made a keto pizza with a ground beef base. Was unpleasantly shocked to find calorie and carb count to be super high on account of cheese. Discouraged, wondering if this is enough to kick me out of ketosis, and asking if I am following the keto lifestyle incorrectly.",1

4764,"Hey guys. Posted something similar to other forums but they weren’t helpful. During this time in the world, likewise to many I have had low levels of motivation to lose weight. Although I am making good progress, every day is a heated argument between me and myself. I know deep down, losing weight is what I want to achieve (to 'prepare for' when my life returns to normal again) until the end of the lockdown, but sometimes, and quite often, this other side of me just wants to indulge on food and leave the losing weight thing until later (i.e. when things get easier like gyms re-open and I'm actually forced to go outside and be active). In the past, I had no problem losing weight during cutting season, but at home I have this constant urge to eat and give up, at least for the time being, and I think I believe that there will be minimal consequences, because I don't have to go outside the next day. How can I be stronger mentally? This is serious. Thanks a lot in advance",1
4765,"Quarantine evokes the most bizarre reactions out of all of us. My neighbors decided that renovating their bathroom during the work week was a good idea. I still had to work from home. So what better time to get out by yourself (if you're allowed to) and go for a bike ride, right? Minimal interactions, yet slow enough to take in everyone and everything around you. In February I set a goal to ride 100km in a day while on a keto diet. Some of the articles I read stated that keto was a suboptimal diet for cycling because muscles use carbs for quick energy when sprinting. Other articles stated that keto was the best diet for endurance cycling, drawing energy from stored fat (sounded good to me, I had enough of that). So I just went for it. I started at 1,60m (5ft 2inches), 113kg (250lbs) in February, now I'm at 99kg (218lbs) with noticeable body composition changes, less migraines and a 15bpm lower resting heart rate. But even better: I ditched metros, busses and car's for bike rides, freedom and joy.

When this whole Corona thing started I had already owned a decent bike for four months, started commuting to work - a very short, flat ride of around 3-4km (2 Miles). I rode at a snail's pace and still felt like I died after 10-15 Minutes of moderate effort. So I got a new bike, a nice gravel bike, made to conquer anything from road, to gravel roads, to double track, even a bit of singletrack. The first longer ride I did was in February, a distance of 15km (9 Miles) - in a time of over an hour. After this ride I needed to take like a week off because everything was hurting... my butt, my legs, my knees. But I kept riding after recovering, increasing the distance and pace one ride at a time. Before I knew it, I was comfortably riding for 2 hours (around 40km or 25 Miles) way faster than before and without a whole lot of exertion.  

I did two long test rides of 55km (34 Miles) and 70km (43 Miles) to see where I stood and if the goal was even in my reach. In my research I read that bonking because of not eating enough carbs for the ride was not a thing with the keto diet. I proved this wrong by bonking both times. Hard. So after dragging my dizzied and headached self home I took a look at what happened and determined that one bottle of electrolytes per hour wasn't enough.  
With a new plan and enough fluids and electrolytes I set off yesterday and guess what: [I did it!](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EXGf9BfXQAELAYo?format=jpg&amp;name=large)  

This post isn't meant to be about me, though. I see a lot of people just getting into cycling and thought I'd share some lessons that I had to learn the hard way.  

* Starting out: Just go for it! I do around 3-4 rides per week, ride far and hard enough to feel exhausted for the day but not like you want to die immediately. You don't need any training plans or whatever to improve, especially when starting out. Repetition is key in endurance.
* Clothing: Wear whatever you like! Sportive, not too loose clothes work best. I ride with a T-Shirt and Shorts. When I started to ride for longer than 2 hours I got a pair of bib shorts, best decision I could've made. Don't worry about getting an expensive cycling kit because either they don't come in big people's sizes or they're not going to fit in a few months when you're loosing weight.
* Shoes: You do not need cycling shoes! Flat shoes with a firm or rigid sole work best. Running shoes tend to absorb energy because of their cushioning.
* Fluids: Bring water with electrolytes. A lot of it. At least 500-700ml per hour. First I tried to bring two bottles one with an electrolyte tablet, one without it, a common strategy but after feeling dizzy and getting headaches left and right I found out that with keto you need more of dem sweet salts than people on a normal diet.
* Food: I brought 4 quests bars (for protein) and a packet of salted nuts (fats and sodium) with me for that 5 hr ride. I ended up eating 3-4 handfuls of the nuts. Somehow I didn't get hungry at all.
* Routes: Do plan your route wisely. I ended up splitting the 100km into a loop of 70km and 30km and a quick stop by my apartment to refill my water bottles. Don't go too far when you're starting out. Have a plan when you need to abort the ride. As you gain confidence in your bike and your body's needs you can increase the radius of your loops.
* Pacing: The most important thing. Try to ride so that you feel like you're working but not gasping for air violently. If you're coming towards the end of the ride and know you can make it home easily start going harder if you want to. Spin, don't grind. Go for a higher cadence, especially on hills, your knees will thank you. 
* Post-ride: Drink a protein shake in the first 30mins after ending the ride. It helps recovery and feeds your sore muscles.

4766,Between August 7 and December 13 last year I was strict and loss nearly 40 pounds. I got lazy through the holidays and a few pound (5-7) crept back on. I want to continue my weight loss journey but I am struggling to get the discipline back. Losing 24 more pounds would give me a healthy BMI. I do well for a few days than I binge on junk food (chips or candy). How do I get back in the groove?,1
4767,"Hey friends! I have been keto since November and I'm loving what it's doing for my body. However I have found I'm a lot more cranky and irritable these days, which I chalk up to the low carbs. Anyone experience this and if so, what low carb options have you found to combat this?",1
4768,"So I didn’t even know I was in Ketosis. I have had a crazy rash for 3 weeks all over my trunk and neck. I’ve used a very strong cortisone cream for the 3 weeks and taken antihistamines EVERY SINGLE DAY nothing worked. 

Today I went to a dermatologist who diagnosed me with the keto rash. How can I get rid of this?? What is it?? What are safe foods I can eat to make me better again?   Shall I eat bananas? Or a drink a can of Coke?

What are some things my fellow ketoers have done? Shall I stop exercising?

How do I add photos to a Reddit post 😂

4769,"My first try at keto, I lost 30lbs (mostly water weight I believe - I was very bloated and began peeing non stop!) in 18 days. I was *feeling* myself, and then my birthday rolled around and I fell off the wagon. Slowly, slowly it crept back up over the year and now I’m back to where I started 😔

Now I’m trying again. 48 minutes into day 4, and thankfully it seems easier this time around. I’m eating dirty keto to make it easier on myself. Like today I had 1/4 of a quest pizza so I don’t feel deprived, and I have keto cups as an emergency sweet, which I’ve only eaten one of thus far.

As of the morning of day 3 I had already lost 8lbs. Feeling very motivated, hoping that I can keep up the momentum.

This probably isn’t the best thing to do, but I’ve been eating once every 4 hours (for example, the 1/4 quest pizza with a small salad, a can of tuna with a pickle, bone broth w/ a little bit of garlic avocado oil added and some olives, a mushroom/spinach omelette cooked in ghee, so on) and I haven’t been hungry at all.

Here’s to hoping keto stays easy for me!",1
4770,"I recently bought a keto-mojo blood sugar and ketone monitor.  One of the first foods I wanted to test was the Franz Keto Bread.   The ""modified starch"" is relatively new being counted as a fiber, so I wanted to check my reaction to 2 pieces.

Time Line:

*6:30 AM* wake up = **93 G,  1.5 K, 3.4 GKI**

*1:00 PM* Fasting   = **79 G,  2.8 K, 1.5 GKI**

*1:00-1:15* ate 2 pieces Franz Keto bread, 1 tablespoon pb, 1 tablespoon almond butter, 1 tablespoon coconut oil, 4 grams AVB flour, &lt;1 teaspoon erythritol.  Net carbs beside bread &lt;4.

*1:15-2:00* Short bike ride to store for hard seltzer.  Normal low intensity bike ride, I usually ride my bike to lunch and back so normal activity for me.

*2:00-3:00* Drank 12 oz hard seltzer w/ 2g carbs while playing video games.

*3:00*  2 hrs after eating **73 G, 2.5 K,  1.6 GKI**

&amp;#x200B;

**It did not seem to have much of an effect on my glucose levels**.  Even including the \~5 grams of carbs from garnishing and seltzer.

Modified starch is not the same as normal fiber, and anecdotally did not have the same clearing effect high fiber foods would have for me.  Did not experience gas or other issues some report.  Nutrition is low,  I would not consider this a staple, and should be consumed in moderation. I would not count ""modified starch"" Toward fiber goals until further research is done.

I can see making sandwiches or burgers with this.  I prefer it toasted.  Normally it is a bit spongy.  Makes a decent toasted cheese.",1

4774,"Hello Everyone,

Just wanted to share my keto story, and hope it might inspire someone who is on the edge of wanting to start.  Believe me it works and just do it.

As most have traveled thru the same journey as myself. I have always struggled with weight gain and loss. Losing 5Lbs regaining 10 etc, etc. My keto journey started last year, when my wife of 41 beautiful years developed breast cancer. At that time I was a 62 years old 5'7"" and weighted 272. After she was on chemo for about a month, she was in pretty bad shape, and couldn't even get out of bed I had to carry her to the bath room. I finally realized  how bad of shape I was in, after a couple of days. I made a appt to with my primary and had my annual physical. When he called with the results of my blood work, he said  you better get all your affairs in order because with the results of the blood test , he didn't know how I was alive  he had never seen any results this high, and I would most likely be dead of a heart attach or stroke any day. I left there thinking  shit what's going to happen to my wife if I die. That night while laying next to her in bed, trying to look up some chemo side effects, I must have typed in something wrong and something about keto diets came up in the search, switched back to my correct search. at about 2 in the morning after again trying carrying her to the bathroom . I went back again and started looking at this keto diet thing. Went to youtube and started to look at some of the video's , and decided why not. I have to try something if not for me for her and us. That very morning I started and never looked back.  Started following  it very closely. I was astonished, I was never hungry , after 2 weeks didn't crave any sugar at all. After a month noticed my pants we starting to be very lose. after 2 months had to take out some old new pants because the old ones kept falling down. I started feeling so much better, but really didn't think much of it, because I was taking care of my beautiful wife. about 4 months latter when I took her for chemo, one of the doctors  there asked me if I was feeling ok, because I looked like I had lost so much weight, didn't think much of it, then he asked if I needed some in home care to help take care of her because it looked like it was taking a toll on me, but declined.  As she continued with her chemo it was a night mare, but she was a trooper. But as she progressed even she noticed my weight loss,  I kept on telling her it was the chemo and all the weight she was loosing that was effecting her eyes ....lol. anyway months turned into a year,  and 3 months later after her last antibody treatment and receiving the news that she in now CANCER FREE. 

When we got home as we walked up the stairs of the house as I opened the door for her, I said wait, picked her up carried her thru the door thru the house into the bed room and laid her on the the bed, Kissed her and said thank you for being the best wife , friend, mother and lover in the world. Recently went back to doctor, and he didn't even recognize me, asked if i was feeling ok, laughed at him and said no problems, just keto,  blood results were fantastic 

Results to now  Wife is much much better,  and I am right now 179 total lost  93 lbs and counting  looking to lose another 4 lbs, all done with out any excursing.  Life good",1
4775,"I apologize ahead of time for the length, but this post might make all the difference to someone, so I'm going for it. 

Background :

 Ive yo-yoed throughout the years, always gained weight when things got really bad in my life, then would lose it later in unhealthy and unstainable ways. My dad committed suicide in 2017, and within 6 months, I gained 100 lbs. Really drank and ate my feelings, and reached an all time high of 275 lbs as a result. Hated the way I felt physically, ability, and performance wise. Felt like i was trapped and drowning in my own skin. Couldnt move as well, back and knee pain started happening frequently, and had acid reflux all the time. Worst yet, this person looking back at me in the mirror was at odds with who I am inside. I was so sick of feeling like crap, and started trying to make changes the end of 2018 into 2019. In that time period, I got down to 245, struggling the whole time, not doing anything differently than I ever had before. And I was still miserable. Then it finally happened. I had some positive life experiences come about that really opened my eyes and made me see everything in a new way. So I started intentionally working on my mindset and perspectives. I still struggled a while longer though, these shifts didnt happen over night. I spent all of 2019, and into early 2020, educationg myself, forcing myself out of my comfort zone, and experimenting. I grew up in an unhealthy environment, around unhealthy people, and had really a poor understanding of nutrition and fitness, so ive had a lifetime of toxicity and misinformation to battle. It's taken a lot of time, effort, and perseverance on my part, but it's been worth every second.

Today:

I started keto 4/3/20. 
Stats: 24f, 5'2"", SW: 240 lbs, CW:225, GW:140. 

I did my weigh in this morning, for my one month Ketoversary, and I'm officially down 15 lbs ! I am beyond thrilled ! ...It hasn't been an entirely perfect journey for me...  It was a real struggle when aunt flow stopped by, coupled with the high intensity and physicality of my job, and I had a couple of slip ups (minor) at work (please people, show your healthcare workers love by sending healthy options, PUT DOWN THE DUNKINS AND PIZZA !!!)... but you know what, I felt the guilt, faced it, held myself accountable, and then kept it moving and didnt give up. I know it's only been a month, but this is the longest I've ever tried doing things the right way and stayed on track and positive. I didnt slip back into the old mindset of ""well today's already ruined anyway, might as well just go buck wild before I have to start all over again tomorrow"". I didnt revert to ""I already failed, my mom was right, I'm always gonna be fat, so I should just give up while I'm ahead and be content with my lot in life."" I didnt beat myself up, hold myself to unrealistic standards, or slip into despair and sadness.
I TREATED MYSELF WITH THE SAME KINDNESS, POSITIVITY, AND CONSIDERATION ID SHOW SOMEONE ELSE. 
It's been a month, and I've lost 15 lbs... 
But more importantly, it's been a lot longer than a month, and I've gained a healthy relationship with myself, my body, and food.

4776,"Hey, I am a 21 year old Male that currently weighs 319lbs (145kg).
I have struggled with obesity my entire life, mainly because of my horrible tendencies and eating habits.
Around the beginning of 2019, I had some success losing little bit of weight by going to the gym weekly, but after few months, my eating broke losing weight.

I've spent 15 years of my life in obesity, and I finally have found the motivation to turn my life around.
My brother has been cheering and trying to help me with weight-loss, and trough him I heard about Keto diet.

I did research into it, and how it essentially works..

The problem is that I suck at eating vegetables.. Probably the reason I have so much weight on me in the first place.

I really want to turn my life around, I want to make myself more energized, and most importantly.. healthy.

I am turning to your help, Since I suck at eating vegetables and healthy overall, I would like help with organizing my diet for my Keto plan.

I know that I have to start eat more vegetables if I want to see more results, I need to get over my ridiculous gag reflex when eating some lettuce, I really want that.

I would dearly appreciate if some could help me with organizing my dietary plan for Keto, any tips are welcomed.

(PS. This is my first reddit post ever. So sorry if it is little unorganized.)",1
4777,"Hi!

I used to be on the keto diet earlier, and I loved it! It helped me lose weight, gain energy and generally worked really well for me.

After a couple of years I ""fell off"" the diet, and have recently tried to get back, but since last time I've developed quite a heartburn issue. Whenever I eat fatty foods, I almost immediately get a heartburn, and it can get quite painful (especially at night when I'm lying down).

I've been to the doctor a few times with my heartburn issue, and I would get some tablets/liquid prescribed that would ease the pain when I wasn't eating fatty foods, but once I started eating it would stop working.

So does anyone have tips for how I can combine keto with my heartburn? Is there any keto-heartburn-friendly food out there, or is there a more permanent solution?

Any tips/help are welcome!

TL;DR: I get painful heartburns when eating fatty food, need help on being on keto and not get these heartburns.",1
4778,"Hello!

I bought this self-proclaimed Keto Berry Granola, which for 40g states on the label is “less than 6g of net carbs.”

For 40gs on the nutrition label it’s 8.9g carbs. Then fibre for a 40g serving is 8.5g.

When I input this into CarbManager, for a serving it gives me 0g net carbs. Which is it?? 

If it is indeed 6g net carbs, it doesn’t feel like a particularly low carb breakfast to me...given if you have it with Greek yog, it comes to a total of 9g net carbs. That’s basically half the days carbs done!

Any ideas which is correct??

4782,"Hey y'all, happy Monday! I'm down about 60 pounds from my starting weight (230&gt;176, aiming at 140) and I keep running into this mental hurdle

The last time I was around this weight was 6 years ago, and I had been struggling for years to lose weight to stay at that number. And that evil gremlin in the back of my mind keeps reminding me that I was trying to lose weight THEN too and was unsuccessful, and ended up gaining 60 pounds more from there, so this is like a giant obstacle number in my head!! 

This obviously doesn't make sense because I was a different person with very different skills and knowledge 6 years ago. How well I did at weight loss THEN does not affect me now! I'm a new person in a new life and I have a much better relationship with myself and with food. I can do whatever it takes for me to get last this barrier. And doing that is all that will get me through it, I know, so I'm going to try to just bust through it... but I wondered if anyone else experiences this?

5266,"Hey all!

I’m about two weeks into ketosis. I’ve been testing daily with blood, averaging around 1.0.

I’m 21/male 6’1 171lbs.

From December-&gt;April, I went from 199-&gt;176 with calorie counting and lifting.

With keto, I’ve been trying to hit 180f/80p/30netcarb. I haven’t been strict with calories. 

I do flexible IF. minimum 14 hour fast daily. usually 16/8.

I workout 3/4 total days a week. Running approx 5 miles a week and full body lifting routine 3 days a week.

I have definitely leaned out... it looks like it was just water weight leaving my body.

It doesn’t look like I’m losing fat. I fell very quickly from 176-&gt;170 the first week. My weight has been the same for about 8 days now. I’ve actually gained a pound from 170-171. 

I’m thinking it could be a few things... can someone advise?

1.) too many calories? I’ve heard both sides... one side says “eat as many calories as you want as long as you don’t go over with carbs. Unlimited fat.” The other side says I need to eat below maintenance. Which have you found to be true?

2.) not in a deep enough state of ketosis? I’ve been around 0.8-1.2. Obviously I’d like to go deeper. I’m confused how long it will take and why I’m not getting there quicker.

3.) too much protein? I am lifting. Some days during this my protein has been as high as 150g. However, generally it’s less than 80.

4.) not enough fat? I don’t know if I could fit more far into my diet without throwing up. Lol. I’ve been hitting around 200g.

5.) sucralose? Not sure how this affects my blood sugar personally. Haven’t tested consistently.

What are your thoughts? Am I just impatient? Maybe the rapid water weight loss got me excited and now this relatively slow weight loss is just looks slow in comparison. Maybe I ate too many calories and put on weight lifting. I have no idea. 

Thanks!

5267,So I have a really hard time with binge eating. I always feel SO hungry. I don’t keep snacks much in my house but sometimes I could really use something just to munch on. What’s your favorite guilt free snack? If I don’t find something soon I’m worried I’ll do something I’ll regret out of impulse and I’d like to avoid it.,1
5268,"Keto has been one of the absolute best decisions I've ever made.  Every aspect of my health has improved, and most aspects of my life.  I remain committed to this way of eating as the best thing for me.

But you know, the last 2.5 weeks have been just hell in one respect - binge eating.  I understand now, in a way that I only understood from an academic perspective, just how much my recovery from binge eating is a process that I continue, each and every day.  And prior to the last 2.5 weeks, that process was mostly mindless.  Meal plan and measure, meal plan and measure.  Now that I'm in maintenance, I give myself more latitude, so if I'm extra hungry because exercise or activity kicked my hiney more than I planned, I eat a bit extra.  No biggie.  I stay keto.  The weight scale stays stable.

I'd not binged since June 14, 2018.  But April 14th, 2020?  The stressors in my life won.  I logged my defeat in Cronometer.

Ok, it's one day.  Each day is a new day.  Back to meal plan and measure, meal plan and measure.  

April 19th?  Logged that defeat.  

Ok, fuck it, a full ban on all nuts for a week if I can't control myself!  Meal plan and measure, meal plan and measure.  

Made it through the week long nut ban.  But binged on other stuff instead, more than once.

Yesterday was the worst day yet.

I know what I need to do - this isn't a cry for help.  I know putting this in writing, throwing this out here, will help me.  Maybe it will help someone else.  While the last 2.5 weeks have seen some days where I lost, I saw more days where I didn't, and I can move forward re-committing myself to my health and well-being.  I make no excuses, but I can be compassionate with myself.  My recovery continues, each day.",1

I'm 28, 6'5"", M. I weighed 256 when i started and now I'm down to 204 after 10 weeks!

I was feeling really great until the other day i started feeling weak and lightheaded. One night i got up to use the restroom and i fainted in my room and I was very disoriented. Since this event i've felt light headed while standing up multiple times and find myself having to stand and wait til I can re-focus my vision. I haven't seen a doctor yet because I thought I'd come here for help first. I assume that I have some sort of mineral deficiency but I thought I'd put it out there.

5278,"Keto Microwave Chocolate Chip Cookies https://imgur.com/a/oeMCigs

Full transparency...this is where I got the recipe from...but the written ingredients here are based on what I used today.

https://www.thedietchefs.com/keto-chocolate-chip-cookies-in-1-minute/

Photos are of my actual results.  There are 3 images.

1 tbsp coconut oil (melted)
1 egg yolk
1/2 tsp vanilla (pure)
1/2 C almond flour (bleached, fine)
3 tbsp Swerve Confectioners 
1/2 tbsp Krista Chocolate Chips 

Melt coconut oil in medium mixing bowl.
Add egg yolk and vanilla, combine.
Add Swerve, combine. 
Add almond flour, combine until nice dough forms.
Fold in chocolate chips

Split dough into 2 balls and press into two larger, greased ramekins (I used 4 inch)

Cook each cookie individually in the microwave for 45 to 60 seconds...check at 45 seconds...cookie should still be very soft. The longer it cooks the more crunchy it will be once cooled.

Let cookies cool for at least 20 minutes.

Enjoy.

Per cookie (based on my ingredients):
Calories 287, Protein 7.7g, Net Carbs 3.8g, Fat 26.5g

Opinion:

Pros: 

They smell wonderful, they look like a yummy cookie, and they are not the size of a dime. They have a crumbly, but not unpleasant, texture...more like shortbread than a normal chocolate chip cookie, sweetness was just right and ratio of dough to chocolate chips is good. And recipe only makes 2, so even if I eat them both (not ideal), I can go to bed happy.

Cons:

Swerve is leaving a cooling effect on the palate.

Overall would I make these again? Yep! Satisfying and although not exactly like a carby chocolate chip cookie, it's close enough that my craving has been eliminated! I will try using powdered Monk Fruit Sweetener next time, and I enjoyed the crispyness of the outer edges so I might cook right to 55-60 seconds for an overall crunchier cookie...or wait longer to eat as the texture got better after an hour.

Hope this helps someone today!!!",1
5279,"Hello all, 


New to the keto thing. New to all of it, to be honest. I've read up on the basics and the idea of making the body burn fat by cutting off supply of sugar and carbs seems to work. 


Just not sure if combining keto with calorie controlled meal plan is a good idea. I used a keto calculator which told me daily calorie intake should be 1496 (from that 136g fats, 20g carbs and 47g protein). 


I've always been vegetarian so my choices are limited. Not exactly fat/overweight but unfit and working from home has just reduced my activity, indirectly adding to weight gain. 


Reason I want to turn to meal preps is because of working at home, I won't always have the time to prepare separate meals. So just thinking to prepare meals for the week. 2 main meals per day that would supply majority of the calorie intake requirement and have other bits in the middle to cover the remaining calories. 


A few set of questions:
- is it a good idea to control calories while going keto?
- besides just fat, what else do I need? 
- how do you source the remaining necessary nutrients? 
- what's the best way to create an effective meal plan that wouldn't make me want to give up? 


If anyone already is a vegetarian and would like to share their meal plans, please feel free to reach out. It'll be much appreciated. I plan on starting it next week so I'll take a look at all the information provided on this subreddit but feel free to share anything from your experience that isn't already covered in the pinned posts.",1

- Yes, you might lose some strength. However, it's really easy for detrained individuals to gain the muscle back afterwards.

I understand, that some of us might really have it bad, as in losing their job and such. But it's quite obvious, that for most people complaining here, that's not the case.

Let's stop with the excuses, and let's use the time to better ourselves. 

If you need help and are struggling, asking for people to help you deal with this situation is great. Asking for people to give tell you that you are not responsible at all for your situation, and all the blame is on the quarantine, is like saying ""yes, you can't gain weight because of your genetics"". Stop saying shit people want to hear, say stuff that's helpful and constructive, while being respectful.",0
5294,"If your goal is to look aesthetic, the mirror should be your main method of measurement. Looking good is about symmetry, proportions and low body fat percentage. 

Nobody cares if you weigh 180 or 130, and everyone is going to look different at different heights. If you want to look good, putting on a bunch of low quality mass just to hit a number on a scale is only going to make you look worse. 

For reference, I’m nearly 6’ and weigh 150lbs, and have had tons of compliments on my physique. Nobody believes me when I tell them I weigh 150. That’s because being lean gives the illusion of being significantly bigger than you are. A very small waist also goes a long way in having a crazy v taper. When I mention my height and weight online, people say I’m sickly thin which isn’t true. You can’t make that call just off weight and height.

This is just my opinion. I think the only valid measurement In terms of weight is change in lean body mass. I could easily weigh 200 lbs if I wanted to but then I’d look soft. 

Downvote me if you want, but gaining weight without muscle (or a low ratio of muscle to fat) is not progress unless you were severely underweight to begin with.

Here’s my before and after: https://imgur.com/a/OCSXMJE for what I believe is good progress, even if I only gained like 25lbs.",0
5295,I recently had lost some weight around the time quarantine happened. I ended up losing some of the bad weight (abdominal area) and have been training consistently. I am gaining around a pound a week and am just proud of the progress. I don’t feel heavier despite gaining the weight and I am getting stronger. I’m hoping to hit my goal by the start of June. Just wanted to share that with y’all. Am very proud of myself,0
5296,"Hello, everyone, I love being in this group. I just want to share my story and how I was able to gain weight and look better than I ever was.

I remember I was 16 years old and I was 135 lbs at 183cm/’6”0 and I felt depressed and not really good enough because I was so skinny. I see pictures of myself now and I am terrified of how skinny I was. Everyone used to tell me to eat more but they didn’t actually tell me HOW to eat more. I was confused. This went on until my early 20’s.

I used to wear baggy clothes to hide my skinny arms and everyone would make fun of how skinny my legs were. Even my own family. Every day when I was outside all I saw were buff guys. I was thinking “How are they doing  this ?” “ How is this possible, I am trying everything but nothing seems to work”.I was frustrated at myself for being that skinny. I hate walking around with baggy T-shirts to hide MY skinny arms and wearing tank tops is out of the question, or getting naked at the pool, at the beach, in front of a woman OR EVEN IN FRONT OF MY FRIENDS. I didn’t love my body and I didn’t love myself. I felt week and unable to protect my girlfriend at the time. How is a man supposed to feel strong and masculine and sure of himself if he can’t even protect his girl?

No one would understand that it can be devastating to my self-confidence to be skinny and lanky and weak and small when all I see around are taller, stronger, buffer dudes.

I tried to eat more and I thought I was eating a lot and to justify myself I would say that I had a high metabolism.

Breakfast was really hard for me to consume since I had zero appetite. If there was a pill that could replace the food I had to eat I would take it. I mean I love pizza and a good meal at a restaurant t, but 90% of the time eating is just a chore that I am trying to complete ASAP. When I was 20 I got a job. The work schedule was tough to combine with eating all the meals and then staying on a calorie surplus. I had to prepare all the meals, go to work and try not to miss any meals because if I did I would feel like I was not making progress.

When I was 20 I joined the gym and took training and diet very seriously. But now another problem arrised. I gained weight but all of it would go to my stomach and love handles. I was getting cocky of how much I progressed until I saw a picture of me on the beach taken by one of my friends. My stomach was bigger than my chest. I got a mentor who really helped me through my journey and I started to see results. Through lots of trial and error, after many failed bulks that put fat in my belly instead of my arms, shoulders, and chest, after a lot of frustration, I finally was able to put on muscle mass. Going to the gym and seeing my body change became a drug to me. It became my passion. Now at 170 lbs and 13% body fat, I feel amazing. My journey continues.

Now what I want to do is help skinny men who can resonate with my story and if you read it until here the chances are high that you are going through the same. Tell me about your experiences. I am curious to hear about it. In the comments or just send me a private message :)

5297,"Just wanted to share a tip I’ve been using to eat more calories - simply drink like a whole glass of water after each meal.

I find that when I do this that I don’t feel so sluggish after a big meal and that I’m able to eat more later in like an 2 hours. 

If I don’t do drink water after I eat a big meal I feel tired and take forever to digest and don’t eat anything for like 5+ hours.

5304,"Hey!   


I have been doing a push/pull/legs split for last month (i live in sweden, everything is open here!) but really not been doing that much progress that I wanted.   
It could be that I have been doing to much isolation exercises which the PPL splits includes and also I think that i have been using to much weight and doing fewer reps then i should. I have mostly been doing 3x4-6 cause I have been enjoying that much more and I thougt if I i got stronger I would also get bigger.   


So to my question, everywhere you read about training your muscle groups as often you can. Most preffered is 3x a week for max growth. Still most recommended program is the 5/3/1 which I have been looking at lately.   
I dont know what to do here, who to listen to. The program that most people recommend and seem to praise buts still is build on one compound per week or training a muscle 3x per week?

5306,"Since we are all stuck at home right now during the quarantine, I’ve decided to share to you guys a routine I’m having fun with right now at home. 

All I have in my Home Gym is a Bench Press, a Pullup Bar, Resistance Bands, Adjustable Dumbbells and a Barbell with weights up to (320lbs). Not an Olympic barbell though, just a skinny one with old pig iron plates that I repainted. Overall it’s a good setup but lacks a Power Rack for Squats. 

It’s essentially a modified Push/Pull routine that has been around for ages. The reason why I like this routine is because there are no specific leg days and I am also able to workout almost every single day(sometimes a take a rest day if I feel overtrained but that rarely happens).

Each workout is a full body workout except  the pushing muscles(Chest, Quads, Triceps, Shoulders) are done separately from the pulling muscles(Back, Hamstrings/Glutes, Biceps). 

In this routine you are able to hit the large muscle groups for 15 sets each week and the smaller muscle groups for about 12 sets each week so volume is pretty much enough for maintainance or even growth. 

Schedule: Alternate Push and Pull workouts daily and take a rest day on Sundays or whenever you feel like it. 

Progression: Add weight once you reach the top of the rep range. 

Rest Times: 3-5 minutes on the main lifts, 1-2 minutes on the accesories.

1. Bench Press 
5 sets of 5-8 reps

BUT wouldn't that be ""waste of time"" and too much volume for front delt, and since incline bench works the same acc. muscles like triceps and front delts. I feel like i could swap in some rear delt work instead of OHP?

6’2” 218lbs

Bench: 255

Squat: 335

Deadlift: 365

Realized I was pretty chunky and my form probably wasn’t great, so I cut down to 180 and lost a bunch of strength but started to focus more on form. I started 5/3/1, and after another 2 years I’m at:

6’2” 190lbs

Bench: 265

Squat: 365

Deadlift: 425

However, I hit these maxes last summer and can not for the life of me improve strength, especially in bench. As you can see, I’ve only improved 10lbs on bench in almost 3 years. I know I could eat more (I’ve been eating ~3800cal with ~180g protein). The only supps I take are creatine and preworkout (nothing too crazy).

**Lifts** (Beginning --&gt; 1.5 yr --&gt; Current

Bench - 75x9 --&gt; 115x9 and 135x2 --&gt; 135 x 12 and 155 x 5

Squat - 115x5 --&gt; 160x7 and 185x1 --&gt; 185 x 10 (no max)

Deadlift -idk --&gt; 295x1 --&gt; 315 x 5 (haven't deadlifted consistently in a while as it is one of my better lifts and comes naturally to me, but goal is to push this to 4pl8s soon)

OHP - like 80?x1 --&gt; 100x1 --&gt; 95 x 10

**Beginning:** Was active my entire life playing 2-3 sports each year all the way through high school. When swim-team ended the my senior year of high school, I needed to find something to exert myself physically. Wanting to feel better about my body, I undertake the journey of the iron. I started off by counting macros and following SL 5x5. Unfortunately, my progress stalled out relatively quickly as I wasn't eating enough for fear of getting fat (stupid). Thinking my program was the root of the problem, I program-hopped for a while trying out the reddit PPL, nSuns for a brief bit, and some programs of my own creation. My progress was still lackluster until I got to college where I finally started eating more. Weighed around 125 at this time.

**College (Year 1):** Once I got to college, I followed a loosely structured PPL and started working out with a gym buddy. By loose PPL, I mean that I ordered my routine in a Push-Pull-Legsx2 format, but the exercises for each day I figured out when I got there, going by feel but typically very high volume with 1.5-2 hour sessions. Often ended up spending too much time hitting chest or back and just throwing some arms in at the end, which led to lagging arms (still trying to bring up). One of the reasons I think this worked so well is that my gym bud was able to push me on my sets even though I wasn't tracking progression. While my muscular gains were good during this period (given the high volume and high food intake), my strength gains were lackluster as I lacked neural proficiency in the movements because I was swapping my main movements out every session. Looking back, I wish I had followed a set progression for the big 3 + OHP + weighted pull-ups and then followed up the rest of that session with high volume isolation and pump work.

**College (Year 2):** Heading back home over last summer, I experimented with a variety of different splits but kept my core principles pretty constant. Start with heavier compound movements before moving into isolation movements. One of my favorite splits I ran was Push/Pull/Legs/Chest+Arms/Back+Shoulders/Legs. Also experimented with dropping back squats completely and making hack squat a primary leg movement which gave me good quad gains (long-legged, proportions not great for skwats). Was trying to bulk from 150 --&gt; 160 over that summer, but a physically active job meant I was underestimating my TDEE and I only gained around 2 pounds, which made for a nice recomp.. I guess? Since summer of last year (2019), my weight has fluctuated between 150-155 lb, so the past half year has mostly been one massive recomp. While this has certainly improved my body composition, it can be disheartening seeing the SLOW strength gains.

**Advice:** Unlike many people on this subreddit, I do not believe following a set program is entirely necessary. I think if you are able to push yourself to ACTUAL (failure), at least on the last set of every exercise, you can get great muscular gains programming movement by feel. While this if fun in the gym, I would recommend trying to push up numbers over time on one main movement each day which can be reassuring that you are doing something right and give you motivation to hit the gym hard (also nice because you can tell yourself ""just have to get through this heavy bench before I can go ham on the cable crossover). Also, in terms of diet, try your best to reach a caloric surplus by eating healthy food, but if you need to throw some dirty food in, it isn't the end of the world.

I’m currently lifting about 6x a week because there’s not much else to do in quarantine. I don’t want cardio to decrease strength gains. So how do you integrate cardio into a lifting workout? Do i run before or after lifting? Do I not lift on days I do cardio even if this will reduces strength gains?,0
5359,"Hi,

I’m a transwoman (24, 5’10”, 130) and have been on hormones for a little over a year. I noticed changes in my face and frame after the first couple of months but then after that it sort of stagnated. 

After weighing myself last week, I’ve actually lost weight since starting my transition (about 10lbs). I’ve always struggled being underweight, but I know that something has to change, as my breasts, hips, and butt won’t fill out if I’m not putting on pounds. 

What’s a good strategy aside from just “eat over 2000 calories a day?” 

Also, I want to get into a healthy shape, but am worried cardio would only hinder my goals to put on pounds. Advice on exercises as well?",0

5363,"Greeting Gainers,

I greatly enjoy this subreddit and always want to make content on/for it, so today I wanted to discuss the infamous [""Super Squats""](https://www.amazon.com/SUPER-SQUATS-Pounds-Muscle-Weeks-ebook/dp/B005KCKT0Y/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3CR1RJRRA9HVI&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=super+squats&amp;qid=1588811244&amp;sprefix=Super+Squats%2Caps%2C3062&amp;sr=8-1) program.

**BACKGROUND**

Now, if you clicked the link, let me start with the the whole ""30lbs of Muscle in 6 weeks"" thing is definitely not a scientific statement, but just reported anecdotes of dudes that ran the program back in the ancient history of organized weight training.  Take it with a significant grain of salt.  HOWEVER, this is still a tried and true, time tested program that has been putting muscle on dudes and transforming ""mice into monsters"" for decades.  It's pretty much the perfect program for any ""hardgainer"".

I HIGHLY recommend buying the book for anyone interested in running the program.  It's $10 on Kindle: you have wasted more than that on supplements, I assure you.


THAT said, let me give you a rundown.

**PROGRAM OVERVIEW**

All Super Squats programs (as there are several different ones in the book) are based around a 20 rep set of squats.  Now, before you get all stupid about hypertrophy ranges, keep in mind this isn't a set of 20 reps on squats.  This is a 20 rep set of squats using (ideally) your 10rm.  How do you do that?  By taking 3 (minimum) of the DEEPEST breaths you have ever taken in your life in between each rep.  You students of bodybuilding will realize that this is basically a rest pause set of squats, using a VERY heavy weight, for a stupidly high amount of reps.  

That sh*t will make you grow.

Following that 20 rep set is a 20 rep set of light pullovers.  The goal is to stretch your rib box and make you bigger.  Most folks say the science on that is bunk, but I'll tell you that, after those squats, you'll want those pull overs.  They give you a chance to not die.


The program is centered on those squats, but you add various work to it too, depending on how you run it.  I did a super abbreviated version of it where I did 2 sets of 12 for weighted dips and 2 sets of 15 for bent over rows one day, and 2 sets of 12 overhead press and 2 sets of 15 of weighted chins the next.  Some programs are more rigorous, but that was enough for me.  At the time, I was applying the hardgainer principle of ""do less, recover more"".

You squats 3 times a week, and add 5lbs to the bar every workout (so if you're diligent, you'll do 18 workouts and add 90lbs to the bar)

**NUTRITION**

This program is known as ""Squats and Milk"" because this was the program that started the ""Gallon of milk a day"" craze.  And though the author never flat out states to drink a gallon a day, the amount he advocates (by glasses per meal) adds up to just about that.  This will be consumed on top of a very hearty diet of food.

**SO WHY THIS PROGRAM?**

I feel like this is a great program for a trainee to use as an intro to hard training because it's VERY simple.  No complicated percentages, minimal equipment needed, no quicklifts (snatch or clean): just needs hard work.

**MY EXPERIENCE**

I ran this program in January of 2007.  I had gotten the book for Christmas that year, purely as a curiosity, and the author did such a good job getting in my head that I was hooked.  Ran the full 6 weeks, 3 days a week, and only missed the 20 reps twice.  Ended up at 310lbs for a 20 rep set, and put on 12lbs of weight in 6 weeks, going from 190lbs at 5'9 to 202lbs.  

The program taught me a lot, SPECIFICALLY about hard work and obsession.  Up until that point I had never trained that hard before, and it set me up for a lifetime of being able to train hard for future programs like DoggCrapp, 5/3/1 Building the Monolith and Deep Water.  Additionally, I became obsessed with getting those 20 reps.  After I'd get them, I'd celebrate for all of 3 seconds before I realized I'd have to do it all again in 2 days with even MORE weight, but that wasn't anything compared to how I felt when I FAILED to get the 20th rep.  I felt like all my time that session had been wasted and I was screwing myself out of growth, and I plotted, planned and schemed until my next workout when I'd crush the 20 reps.  Also became obsessed about getting more food in my face so I could recover between workouts and grow.

**YOUR TURN**

I'd love to talk more about the program, either by answering questions, sharing my experience, or hearing what YOU all have experienced running this program.",0
5364,"It’s a simplified title but I’m wondering since I’ve hit a plateau with my chin up progress, if whether doing a high number of chin ups spread across an entire day everyday would be more effective for hypertrophy than sticking to a few sets grouped together every few days.

I’m struggling to find reliable sources to answer this and while I’m sure both would work to a degree, I’m obviously trying to circumvent wasting a month to find out myself if anyone already knows.

I can only get to around 20 when I perform 3 sets of 6-7 and I’m not seeing any progress for a while so I’m thinking of changing up the routine. My goal as per the subreddit is just to get as big as possible

\[Obligatory Progress Pics\]([https://imgur.com/a/KajFqZb](https://imgur.com/a/KajFqZb))

It has been 11 months since I began going to the gym. I have stuck with the same PPL program in that time and I feel its given me the results I have been looking for. I've been mostly consistent with going 4 /5 days a week- roughly about an hour and a half to two hours each session and its worked out pretty well!

I have had an obvious advantage of living with a professional PT who- while admittedly has only helped me about once a month on form correction on my workout- has absolutely taught me and has helped me figure out nutrition which is a critical component to body building.

Honestly, I used to play heaps of games and kinda just treated the gym as one- stats inclusive.

At this stage, i've reached my first real plateau and is a mix of being stuck in maintenance mode from corona and not being to access more than just resistance bands. I don't really have the tools for the job to take myself further than where I am now.

My ORP lifts are as following:

Bench: from 50x1 KG to 105 KGx1

Deadlift: from 70x 1 to 145KG x 1

Squat: from 60KG x 6 to 140KG x 3 (I have been quite slack in my squat gains compared to the rest)

I always aim for 170g of protein intake per day but how I get there I don't stress too much over as I have memorised a lot of the approximate amount of grams of protein my meals have.

I still wear the same awful blue shorts to the gym but i've learned to TUCK MY GODDAMN UNDERWEAR IN.

I have also finally started doing cardio in the form of walks and occasional jogs with the girlfriend.

Its been a good time and hopefully 12 months from now I can report even further gains.",0

I'm a 23 year old male at 5'10"" and weigh 128lbs (on a good day)
I am absolutely sick of my stick figure frame and decided I'm going to start working out and start eating as much as I can. 
I thought I was doing really good over the last few weeks. Eating as much as I possibly can and putting on some strength from working out. So I decided to download My Fitness Pal and count my calories. I was aiming for atleast 2500 calories and figured I was somewhere around that number. Turns out I'm not even KINDA close! I've been stuffing my face with rice and tuna until I can't possibly eat anything else and it turns out I'm only at 1300 calories...
I've been having porridge for breakfast, snacking on fruits, cheese and crackers and bought some protein powder (I can drink it when I can't get any more food in me) and still I'm nowhere near my goal.
I literally cannot get one more piece of food in me at the end of the day and I feel stuffed all throughout it. 

I honestly just feel like giving up and accepting my horrible physique. It sucks because I feel so so much better when I work out and it helps me eat more in return. Although not enough apparently.
I saw a dietitian a few months ago and they basically told me to start eating more. Yeah... So helpful...

5435,"I wanted to share some methods that have worked for me when it comes to weight gain over the past 3yrs. Bit of background first though! 

I started when I was 16 years old at about 140lbs/63.5kg. I had never watched what I ate and I was a naturally skinny kid, always had been. Currently, I’m 19 years old and about 210lbs/95.3kg. (I’m also 6ft/1.8m tall)

Onto methods that have worked for me!

Method 1: Liquid calories

This is one that I think most people begin with when trying to gain weight, and rightfully so. It’s a relatively easy way to get calories down even when you don’t feel hungry. When it comes to ingredients, I’ve always used a ton of peanut butter, milk, ice cream, and bananas as bases for my shakes. 

Method 2: Gradual Increase

This is a method that has worked miracles for me. I plateaued at around 180lbs/81.6kg after using liquid calories for a while and I realized that my appetite needed to be higher. This method is relatively simple actually. So lets say your average breakfast is a bowl of cereal, glass of milk, and a yogurt. Eat that for a week, then the next week add an apple to your meal or a bit more cereal than usual. Continue to add little by little. Your body will get used to it. 

Method 3: Eating. Always Fucking Eating.

This method is not the most comfortable or easy one, but dammit it works. When I went to college I went from 205lbs/92.9kg to 185lbs/83.9kg without even trying. My metabolism came back and got me in a choke hold. So, I decided to just eat. Constantly. I switched from 2 meals a day to 4. I got up early so I could eat breakfast. I ate until I felt like I was going to vomit at 1-2 of my meals per day. It is NOT fun but I did bulk up to where I am right now. So as much as you may think “there’s no way, I can’t eat any more.” Yes you can. You can always eat more. 

Another thing that impacted my ability to gain weight is definitely my style of training as well. I do strength training which means rare cardio, so training also has an impact on your weight gain. However, that's a whole other topic. These are three methods of eating that have worked for me! I hope this is helpful for some of you. I wish you all the best of luck. Now go eat.",0
5436,"Ive been bulking for the last several months with great success but would like try make my diet that little bit healthier. My diet isn’t particularly bad, as most of the processed food I eat is dairy, but I would be interested in cutting out dairy too. I’m a “hard-gainer” and have to have a massive calorie surplus to make any gains, which has led me to drinking 2 litres of milk a day just to make some gains. The only other processed food I eat is Greek yogurt, which I use to make bread, some dark chocolate and the occasional bag of lentil chips. I like to make my energy levels my number 1 goal so I feel cutting out the dairy may help with that, as 2 litres of milk can be high in sugar and could be potentially difficult on the digestive system",0
5438,"I read [this post](http://mythicalstrength.blogspot.com/2020/03/maybe-you-should-just-quit.html?m=1) a few days ago and I'm wondering if I should just quit. Bulking has become an constant nuisance. I get that this isn't suppose to be easy but if I'm going to do it I need a good reason to, lately I'm not finding enough reasons to continue. First of all, is force feeding myself bad from a health perspective? If I want to live a long and healthy life, I don't see why I would need mass that my body clearly doesn't want. 

I'm enlisting in the military soon and I'm betting that trying to add mass is counterproductive. Right now I should be prioritizing cardiovascular health and staying lean.

When I was 6'1 135 yeah it was definitely worth it, I looked malnourished. Now I hover around the 160s and I don't see the point in pushing all the way to my goal of 200. It seems like all you need to do is be lean to get the vast majority of the benefits I want. I want to look great naked, I want to get stronger and I want to have a physique that men find admirable and women find attractive. 

Will 30lbs really make that much of a difference? 170 at 10% body fat is roughly 30lbs away from my genetic potential but it's still bigger/leaner than most men will ever be. Can anyone who's lived in both worlds, a lean ottermode type physique vs a jacked biggest guy in the room physique, share their experience? Right now I feel like my time would be better spent recomping/slow bulking until I reach a lean 170. I feel like this strategy would also be useful for others who are already at a decent weight. Eat at maintenance, keep protein high, train hard and let the training fuel the appetite instead of force feeding.

In my case, sometimes doing 10-20 push ups are enough to get to failure, but the problem is that I don't know how many sets I need to do to build muscle. 100 reps a day? 200? 300? I just don't know, it's not like Bench Press where anybody knows that 3-5sets are good and I've never heard somebody doing more than 5, but push ups are different.",0
5532,"Alright, so I’m proud of how far I’ve come in terms of gains so far. After 2 years of bulking, I’ve put on a good amount of size. From starting at 155 lbs, and currently being at 200 lbs, I’ve got a solid two years of lifting under my belt. But at my current size, I feel just kinda meh. No one is gonna call me out for being skinny, because I’m definitely not anymore, but I just don’t feel “big” quite yet. I think part of my concern is that I wanna look like a bodybuilder, and I hope to someday reach my natural limit, a goal that many around me don’t understand. When most people look at me in just a t shirt and pants, they’d probably think my physique is like a “college athlete.” But I want more than just that. I’m not satisfied with just looking athletic. I wanna be BIG. HULKING. SWOLE. And I feel a bit stuck in a weird limbo at the moment. I wanna look like an advanced lifter, if that makes sense. One of the bigger guys at the gym. Catch my drift? Does anyone have any advice for an intermediate lifter who just wants to take things to a completely new level? My lifts are plateauing hard, and I’m not noticing that many results anymore as the months go by. Can anyone relate? Am I nuts? 😂",0
5533,"The scale doesn't mean as much as you think it does. It's sad how often you see on this sub ""I gained 10/20 pounds and I see no difference"". You see no difference because you gained little to no muscle in your 3 month bulk and that's mostly water and fat. 

The truth is that if you want to see long term success, *slow the fuck down*. 10 pounds over 6 months might seem slow, but trust me, those 10 pounds will be quality mass and you will look infinitely better than you will after gaining 30 pounds in the same period. You rationalize it saying that it's okay that you have to put on fat to gain muscle and that you rather air on the side of ""caution"" and gain too much than too little, but even at 1/2 pound a week, *that's still with fat gains included*, so anything other than that is just time and muscle you are gonna waste when it comes time to inevitably cut all your ""gains"". 

It's running in a hamster wheel. You think you are moving ahead because the scale is moving so fast, but in reality you are going in circles. 

Make sure your training is correct and you are progressively overloading, sleep well and eat 200-300 calories a week and aim for 1 pound a biweekly. In no time you'll be just a few pounds heavier but what you see in the mirror will be vastly different with the clean gains.",0
5534,"Edit: clarifying this at the top: this is about the act of eating, not about how to gain more calories which I can already find ways to do.

I've often seen the advice of making my calories liquid (and I have access to that) but I'd also like to try addressing the elephant in the room which is my neglectful relationship with food.

I'm 30, male, 5'11, and usually weigh 135 (or 130 if I've been depressed or busy).

I don't believe it's anorexia, my therapist and doctor have each separately helped me rule that out. Chiefly, I believe the body I see in the mirror is as skinny as it really is, so there's no image distortions or trauma at the idea of eating. I also do not have any rituals or compulsions of behavior after a meal.

I just... Don't eat when I'm hungry? And I believe I often am hungry, it's simply a feeling I can go an entire day without obeying.

Maybe more to the point, I have extreme, supreme difficulty eating when I am not hungry - nearly every meal I have goes half uneaten because I lose interest, and then the idea of even one more bite fills me with revolting nausea. It's also a sensation in my jaw, as if my mouth is informing me it would refuse to chew and swallow if I press the issue.

Anyone else know the tree I'm barking up? Is this something I can strategize past like others have, or should I seek prescription intervention more seriously (which has tough side effects my doctor wants to avoid if we can)?

... Also this post just felt nice to make, so even if all the help I get is having people witness it, I appreciate that in advance.",0

5538,"Hi all

I was running a 5/3/1 before lockdown in a proper gym

I am now trying to get together a program that i can run while in lockdown. I have a barbell with only a few light plates, and some dumbells that are kinda too heavy.

I also do a lot of running so am trying to figure a full body push- full body pull - run three day split.

My conundrum is I want to work legs in to the Push / Pull split. I've sorted the upper body side of it.

Leg work I can do effectively with the gear I have are:

* Squats
* Bulgarian split squat
* Lunge
* Romanian DL

I don't have enough weight to do proper DLs.

I am slotting squats into push days and RDLs into pull days. I want to also put the split squat and lunge in the program as I think they give a lot of bang for buck. However, they both seem to involve a bit of push and pull? They're definitely working the hip flexors and hammies

Any advice where to put in the split squat and lunge? Or any other leg work I could do with what I have? 

I am conscious that i could be doing front squat but find it hard to hold the rack position to do the leg work properly.",0
5540,"This is really long, but it's just uh, a venting/rambling sort of thing. Feel free to ignore and move on. 

In middle school, I starved myself and had a huge issue with how I saw myself back then. I am 17 now. When I was younger I thought everything had too many calories and now I feel like everything has too little :/

Anyway, I used to eat like a champ before that. I didn't think much of puberty for whatever reason so I didn't realize that I'd be thinning out and all, but the slight chubbiness got too much. Not hugely overweight, but just that baby fat that seems to melt off during puberty.

Now I try to eat the same way and although I have the appetite of 50 gorillas, I get bloated fast and have trouble with honestly everything, even the uh, unmentionable stuff. I realized I've been eating too little and have tried over and over for the past year or two. 

But I think I've finally got it. I've been trying to eat 2,000 calories a day and it's really hard but I believe I need more, honestly probably up to 3k. I feel a little less sluggish when I eat this much and it made me realize just how much I need to function normally. I'm starting to get used to it but I still keep feeling like a pregnant man. Since I've figured out I need a lot more fiber than I was taking at first, I am like in heaven honestly. 

The guys in my family are small at first but have huge growth spurts at a late age (like 18-20) and considering how demanding my body is starting to get, I think that mine is coming up. So I'm going to try to figure out how much I truly need and push through this damn ""eat very little"" my body has gotten used to. 

I certainly eat more than in middle school, not like I'm starving but I'm definitely not eating enough and had trouble with trying more because my body couldn't seem to handle it well. It took me a while to realize that it's normal and my body will readjust if i keep it up. Or at least I hope it will figure things out. I'm still trying to expand recipe wise but for the first time I feel like I have some control over my digestive system. It's a good week :)",0

**Why you haven’t gotten results from the gym**

Maybe this scenario rings true to you. One day, you wake up and something inspires you to finally get in shape and build that athletic physique that you have always wanted. You feel the motivation flowing through you. So, You go workout at the gym or at home that day and you’re feeling great. You think to yourself, “I’m finally doing it!”.

You stay dedicated and consistent with the gym for about a month; finally willing to make a change for the better. 

THEN, something comes up at work… The next week or two is gonna be very hectic and busy for you. You think, “I’ll just take a break from the gym so I can focus on my work for a couple weeks, and then I’ll start fresh again.”

After those couple of weeks pass, the gym is calling your name again. However, now you don’t feel motivation. You feel a little exhausted even thinking about going to the gym. It seems too much of an effort to start again. 

You’re back to square one. NO results.

**What went wrong?** 

1. **You aren’t making your health and personal fitness one of your priorities**

Our body is our vehicle through life. If you aren’t taking care of it, how do you expect to live a long, happy, healthy, and fulfilling life? Yes, your career is absolutely important. And relationships with Family and Friends should be a huge priority as well. However, where you are limiting yourself is… these important aspects of your life should NOT be a list of priority. Instead you need to realize, there is a healthy balance between all things important to you. Everything you do affects other areas of your life. 

**This** leads to **that** which leads to **this** which leads to **that** and so on…

For example, it MAY look like this for you:

Eating Healthy and Exercising **&gt;** More Energy and Focus **&gt;** More Productivity in your work **&gt;** More time to spend with family **&gt;** Less stress **&gt;** Happiness and Fulfillment 

2. **Relying on the feeling of ‘Motivation’**

The feeling of ‘Motivation’ is just that… a FEELING. As we know, feelings are always changing. Some days you feel great, Some days you feel lazy, Some days you feel angry at the world. You shouldn’t rely on your feelings. Instead, what you need in order to be consistent with your goals and actually get results is something \~90% of people lack…. SELF-DISCIPLINE.   
When you feel lazy and unmotivated, guess what? You still put in the work because that is what you have to do to see results and finally change your life. Every time you think about giving up, just remember WHY you started this in the first place. Imagine how you will feel and how your life will look like if you build your dream body. And Imagine if you DON’T……

3. **Not having the right plan of action**

This is another thing a lot of people fail to do…. actually following the right method to achieve your specific goal. Sometimes, It can be confusing and frustrating with all the information out there that seems to contradict itself at times. So you end up trying out something for a couple weeks and then you hear you should be doing something else, so you switch methods. This leads to you jumping around from different training routines, diets, and strategies; never seeing results. 

Get someone that has been in the same position as you (and is currently where you want to be), have them help you with your training and nutrition plan, and STICK TO IT. If something isn’t working after a while you slightly adjust on that one thing that’s not working, instead of throwing out everything you are doing and take a whole different approach. 

What do you think? Do you resonate with any of this?

5546,"I’m a 21yr 6” male at 186lbs up from

I’ve been bulking for a couple of months and seen some really good progress, I’ve gained about 20lbs from underweight and I look a lot better. I’ve been eating whole foods most of the time and I’ve cut out alcohol and sugary drinks and whatnot. I’ve made sure to hit my protein goal each day at 190g. I’ve also been taking multivitamins and fish oil tablets each day with 5g of creatine.

My TDEE calculator suggests 2700 for maintenance so I’ve been eating 3200 and working out as best I can given the situation 5-6 times a week working to failure each time with milk gallon bottles. 

Despite all this, my weight has stagnated and won’t go up any more. Surely my maintenance is not 3200? I’m reluctant to eat any more to contribute to this fat stomach I’ve now developed but maybe I should just ignore it? I’ve been skinny my whole life and it’s kinda scary seeing my stomach get bigger.

I wonder if my weight has stopped increasing since I stopped working out my legs a few weeks ago (a temporary decision while quarantined as it’s just too difficult to put enough tensile stimulus with no proper weights.) That being said however I was under the impression muscle atrophy doesn’t occur until 4 weeks or so? I get that people are going to say 1. Eat more and 2. Lift heavier, but believe me I’m doing both these things and I’ve still hit a wall.

Any suggestions?",0

I eat as much as I have the appetite for as well as drink/eat whey protein supplements and take creatine.

I would think it would be enough for me to notice some kind of difference though, but so far you can barely tell I’ve been intensely working out for four months and I’m a little bitter about it. Any advice on how I can bulk up while also keeping this job would be great. Thanks in advance.",0
5650,"For the record, I'm 20 years old, 5'11"", 140lb (I'd guess around 23% body fat) and currently eating around 2200 calories whilst doing zero exercise. Bearing in mind I'm a complete novice whilst not having much muscle, I'm hoping to make quite fast ""noob gains"", and understand I'll need to eat more for that to happen.

So I'm trying to make a meal plan to help me start bulking and I heard on here how important it is to hit your macros. Therefore I ran a few recommended TDEE calculators but got back conflicting results:

IIFYM = 2927 calories - 128g protein, 59g fat, 471g carbs

[tdeecalculator.net](https://tdeecalculator.net) (moderate carbs) = 2711 calories - 203g protein, 105g fat, 237g carbs

[tdeecalculator.net](https://tdeecalculator.net) (high carbs) = 2711 calories - 203g protein, 60g fat, 339g carbs

[calculator.net](https://calculator.net) (for 1/2kg per week weight gain) = 2792 calories - 170g protein, 79g fat, 372g carbs

[calculator.net](https://calculator.net) (for 1kg per week weight gain) = 3292 calories - 210g protein, 94g fat, 439g carbs

I then threw together a quick meal plan (pretty much what I'm currently eating but with healthy snack alternatives + extreme gainer shake with milk before bed) and I can hit around 3000 calories a day, but with the carbs (350-400g), fat (60-95g) and protein (150-180g) varying.

So my questions are:

1. Will that be too many calories? My logic was to take my current consumption, add 200-300 due to working out 3x a week, then add 500 extra as you guys recommend. Hits just over the 2927 recommended by IIFYM, but I was thinking that it should be fine if I really am going to gain a lot from noob gains.
2. Is that enough protein? Some of those recommended figures (looking at you 203g and 210g) look pretty ridiculous, and I've also heard rules such as 0.8\*body weight in lb, which would put me on 112g. I've honestly got no idea which one to listen to.
3. Does it matter that much if my macros are fluctuating slightly like mentioned?
4. Somewhat unrelated but any good snack bar recommendations (UK)?? I've had Nakd bars before but I don't know what the go to is for you guys here.

However, I eat healthy food and people told me I should eat more to get bigger, but when I eat more, even if it's healthy stuff, I gain abdominal fat.

Progress: https://imgur.com/gallery/Go64xnC

Progress with different angles for arms and back: https://imgur.com/gallery/35rpLz0

Doing novice fierce 5 routine. 3 day a week lift adding 5lbs upper body and 10lbs lower body every week. I’ve been able to progress every week since I start basically. I did have to take a few weeks off due to injury at the beginning but I’ve been rolling since. 

Also running 2x per week. Doing 4 sets of 4 50 yard sprints. High intensity workout. 
 
I’m not sure of my Maxs as I don’t have a spotter but I’ll list the weight I’m doing this week for how many sets and reps each exercise. 

Back squat - 195lbs 3 x 5
Bench - 130lbs 3 x 5
Pendlay - 90lbs 3 x 8
Dumb Bell Face pulls 10lb 3 x 10 (was told low weight or it will hit lats)
Calf raise - 50lbs 2 x 15/tricep extension - 50lbs 2 x 10 (superset)

Front squat - 165lbs 3 x 5
Overhead Press - 90lbs 3 x 5
Romanian deadlift - 105lbs 3 x 6
Pull ups - BW + 20lbs 3 x 8
Starfish crunch 10lbs 2 x 15 + leg raises 2 x 15/Dumb Bell curl - 40lbs each 2 x 10

At times when eating large amount of food I almost always gag when I'm starting to become full, especially in the morning. I always have to swallow my food with a mouthful of water to get it down. And sometimes may have something almost come backup.

What should I do? Am I in the healthy weight range for my age and height? Should I gain 10-15lbs? By the way, I have some muscles on my arm and legs, I don't know how much muscles weight but I'm probably like 100lbs without muscles. Thanks",0

5661,"So I took this idea from [AskCulinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/g9c9nj/has_anyone_ever_heard_of_this_egg_based_breakfast/) and did my own twist on it this morning, super easy, versatile, edible, and you probably have all of these ingredients at home. The basic idea is that you:

* Butter some bread, toast it, and cube it up
* Softboiled some eggs (yolk should be runny), cube it over the bread so the bread absorbs the yolk
* Mix it up and spice it up as you'd like (If you want to go the extra mile, start with the cubed bread in a buttered cast iron pan, add the egg, and finish in the oven). 

Ok this sounds pretty basic and as you'd imagine, kind of looks like half-digested barf, but bear with me. You can spice up the recipe super easily, craving Italian? Add olive oil, salt, pepper, oregano, basil, tomatoes, cheese, and bam, homemade Olive Garden. Feeling desserty? Use chocolate bread, drizzle some melted peanut butter, and bam, easy 600 calories.

This morning I did:

* 2 slices of taro bread (For the Canadians, T&amp;T sells some pretty wacky bread)
* 3 eggs
* 2 tbsp melted peanut butter
* Dust some cocoa powder

Add a glass of milk on top of that, tastiest 700 calories I've had for the little effort I've put in.",0

5663,"Hi all, first time posting! Really enjoying everyone's progress photos and the vast amount of information available on here.

This is a very simple two year progression, from a worrying 62kg around two years ago to the 84kg I'm at right now. This was mostly done via a PPL routine, 6 days a week with a none too special diet; as long as I hit around 180g protein a day and around 2500 calories. 

Lifts are currently at: 

Squat 130kg (286lbs) Deadlift 140kg (308lbs) Bench 80kg (176lbs) Row 60kg (132lbs) Lat Pulldown 70kg (154lbs) Angled Leg Press 400kg (881lbs)

Although I am very happy with the progress I've made so far, I still have lots of work to do in order to improve my bench numbers. General idea now is to do a little cut, lower the bodyfat percentage somewhat (currently sitting in the 20-25% mark) and then work on blowing up the chest and forearms. 

Any tips, help or opinions would be greatly appreciated. 🙂

5664,"So over the last year i’ve been bulking, have gotten from 72kg to 85kg, at 6’2. Started properly going to the gym at 80ish kg.

I’m hoping to properly bulk for next rugby season, so had been going to the gym a lot more and using protein eating more calories, and i had bought some creatine however never started a cycle. Since lockdown begun started doing lots of body weight exercises and some weighted (push ups ect...).

Wondering if it’s worth starting creatine now even though i can’t do heavy lifting and have a lack of weights, and doing the loading phase or just starting and maintaining 5g a day.

5666,"I am a 17 year old currently doing a clean bulk (trying to add muscle with as less fat as possible) as a vegetarian, eating +-3100 cals per day. What I’ve noticed is that when I have a varied diet, I often end up getting more or equal (almost never less though) of my calories from fat than from carbs. 

I usually have around a 3:1 ratio of unsatured vs saturated, and almost no transfat. For example, this is what a standard day looks like for me: [example](https://imgur.com/a/sC6kPCV)

5668,"According to more and more bodybuilders, working out while fasting (you train before you eat your first meal of the day) is a game changer when it comes to muscle building and fat burning. The reason for this is supposedly because human growth hormone is increased by 2000% when you are in a fasted state.

Thomas DeLauer has been working out while fasting for a very long time now and he's not exactly a small guy.

Apparently there are some hollywood stars who are using this approach as well when they need to get  buffed before a movie.

5803,"Hey r/gainit!

Honestly, I'm cutting at the moment, so maybe I'll post this over on r/loseit as well, but I had been bulking up slowly over the last \~2 years. Check out my post history for details, but I am 6'3"" and went from \~190 lbs at the end of Summer 2017 (22 years old) when I started really working out, peaked at 217 lbs in early January 2020 (and I'd like to think I picked up a good amount of strength and size), and have since cut to 194 at the moment (25 years old), end of April while still maintaining good amounts of muscle/mostly losing fat.

This is a more generic diet question however, which I think can apply to any phase of your bulk or cut cycles. **Why do most people that are into fitness and bodybuilding eat so much rice and pasta?** We need a core carbohydrate source that acts as a base for many of our meals, and rice &amp; pasta are some of the easiest to prepare and most available (in Canada/USA for sure, if not most of the world). But looking at the **cost, calories, and protein numbers of rice &amp; pasta vs lentils, chickpeas, &amp; soy beans**, I've been recently incorporating more of the latter since watching the [What the Health documentary on Netflix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf44vLndiRM). Is there something I am missing out on?

I am still aiming for the same amount of protein and calories as when I was eating more rice &amp; pasta. &gt;180g protein/day, 2500-2700 calories which has me losing 1.0-1.4 lbs/week while visually retaining muscle mass &amp; strength (AFAIK without a real gym during quarantine). I've heard rumors that soy/plant proteins are lower quality, or effect estrogen/testosterone, but I believe the latter to be largely false. The documentary is certainly trying to convince everyone should to go completely vegan, so there is bias there. I've reduced how much meat, eggs, and dairy I am consuming, admittedly slightly out of fear, and kept protein levels up via the addition of lentils/chickpeas/soy beans where I had previously had rice &amp; pasta. I still eat rice &amp; pasta, but often mix in one of these other three sources. I'd like to think that having a diverse diet is also beneficial.

Here are some **cost, calorie, and protein numbers** of the core parts of my diet:  [https://imgur.com/gallery/6Tk8tMV](https://imgur.com/gallery/6Tk8tMV)  I believe these numbers to be fairly accurate, but please let me know if there's glaring errors. These are from shopping at name brand stores in downtown Toronto, Ontario and I often get a student discount (\~10%) and stock up when things are on sale. All of the lentils, chickpeas, and soybeans are dried and from bulk, not canned. A few things I have observed are as follows:

* First off, lentils/soybeans/chickpeas are not only cheap to start, they are cheap for how much protein you are getting when compared to rice &amp; pasta, even eggs and Greek yogurt
* Greek yogurt is **much** more expensive than I had thought, but I love it so it's sticking around
* As I am aiming for at most 2700 calories with 190g protein, that's a 14.2 ratio calories/g\_protein. My diet is IIFYM but I just care about daily calories and protein. With these three new food sources coming in around 12.4-19.2 calories/g\_protein, I need to still use things like whey protein powder, chicken breast, eggs, etc to keep the protein high while calories stay low enough to cut weight.
* The calories/g\_protein ratio for rice was MUCH higher than I had expected. Always thought that rice was this magic lean, cutting food, assuming you weren't drowning it in sauces. Quite the opposite. Pasta (the rotini) is also high, about double the calories to get the same amount of protein.

Thanks for the read! Hoping to learn a bunch from you all, so please share your facts and opinions. Perhaps it is just a taste/preference thing towards rice &amp; pasta, but I've started to really like using these new foods in my diet.",0

Whats up gainers,

I've been a long time lurker on this subreddit. I don't really post much on reddit in general but I wanted to make this post to serve as some motivation for those who need it. This sub has been a big help in keeping me motivated and i wanted to pay my dues. 

I started out at 132lbs in early January 2019. After quitting a soul sucking job I realized I wanted to change for the better. After I noticed the scale climbing up I buckled down and took my diet seriously and started counting calories. 

I weighed 148lbs in April of 2019. Bulked up to 160lbs and started hitting the gym in June 2019.

I aimed for roughly 3000 calories daily. My diet consisted mostly of shakes in the beginning months of my bulk. I would throw whatever I had in the fridge to make the calorie count over 1000. I would then fill in the rest of my calories with rice, beans, chicken, beef, pasta, oats, peanut butter, milk etc. Fast food also helped a lot with eating my daily calorie intake although i wouldn't recommend it.

At the beginning of November 2019 i weighed 170lbs. My trainer advised me to go on a mini cut so i cut down my calorie intake and shred down to 162lbs at the end of the year. 

Now in 2020, I been full bulk mode. I'm eating 3,650 calories daily, weighing and counting every piece of food i eat. As of today i weigh 180lbs.

My routine hasn't changed since i started lifting. I workout at a friends home gym and we work with what we have. Mostly compounds lifts and dumbbell exercises.

Monday: Chest
Tuesday: Back
Wednesday: Legs
Thursday: Shoulders
Friday: Arms

I used to think it was impossible to gain weight. Turns out i just wasn't eating enough.",0
5805,"hey y’all! so my issue i’ve been having is i cannot seem to gain in my arms or legs. i’ve been eating a lot more and have put on 5 pounds this year so far (huge for me) but it seems whenever i gain it just goes to my gut. i’m in no way fat, i’m 5’3” and around 109 lbs and definitely on the skinny side. i have more weight at the top of my thighs but my legs quickly taper and become really skinny. the larger upper thighs don’t mean i have hips though. i’ve got very rectangular hips and i’d like to minimize my hip dips and increase the size of my legs aswell. i’ve also got twig arms which are so tiny compared to my torso. i workout everyday for about an hour full body with focus on legs, hips, and arms. so again my question is how do i get more weight to go to my limbs because it’s kinda hard to get muscle when there’s minimal mass. and how do i get less rectangular hips? thanks in advance!

5807,"I'm looking for a Lactose free protein powder that I can add to my porridge in the mornings for some extra protein and flavour. From what I read online Whey Protein Isolate seems like the best option, although it costs a bit more than Concentrate. It also says it has less calories than Whey concentrate which I don't like as I'm trying to get in all the calories I can. 

So, I went onto the Bulk Powders website and thought there would be one or two different flavour options under ""Isolate"", but no. Not even close. I was greeted with like 15 different protein powder options:

""Pure Whey Isolate 90""
""Pure Whey Isolate 97""
""Natural Pure Whey Isolate 90""
""Beef Protein Isolate 97""
""Super Pea Protein Isolate""
""Soya Protein Isolate 90""
""Vegan Protein Powder"" etc.

This goes on and on and on and it's confusing to say the least. Do some of these options have less protein per gram than some of the others or something?
I noticed a ""Complete Protein Porridge"" but I feel like it would be cheaper to buy the powder and porridge separately, no?

My solution for awhile has been breakfast casserole in a  9x13 baking dish.

On Sunday I'll make one, and it can go right in the fridge after it's baked and cooled, cut a big square out in the morning and microwave it for 2 minutes and it's ready to eat.

4-5 Potatoes, peeled and cubed
12 eggs
1-2 cups broccoli
1 lb of bacon and/or sausage (or more if you want)
Shredded cheese (I like the cheddar blends)
1-2 cups of whole milk
1 medium onion (can be omitted if you don't like onion).

Cube up enough potatoes to cover the bottom of the baking dish, then add the broccoli and onion evenly.

Cover with shredded cheese evenly, then cook sausage or bacon, chop it up and layer over the cheese.

In a large bowl whisk 12 eggs and about 1-2 cups of milk together (enough to cover everything in the dish) and pour it evenly over everything, if you need more whisk up a few more eggs and milk.

Cover with foil and bake for 45-60 minutes (check the center of the dish to ensure the egg is fully cooked and solid) and take it out to cool.

I cut it into 6 pieces and will eat one a day for breakfast through the week (maybe two here and there if I think I need it).

Right now, things have been especially tough because we have very few staff members at work - I am on my feet the other 8 hours of my shift and walk at least 10 miles every work day (only working 2 days a week right now). I've always had a low appetite, and I can't make myself eat the \~2,000 calories or more at lunch that I would need to eat in order to stay on track on work days. My fitbit says I'm burning over 4,000 calories on those days, and I just can't get anywhere near that type of intake +500cal when I'm working. I can't eat on the job and we can't take food out of the break room. Sometimes I'll go to the bathroom just to shove some peanut butter in my mouth, it's that bad.

So, I was wondering if calorie averages matter more than day-to-day, and if I can make up for the calories I miss on work days by eating more on my off days? When I'm not working, I can eat all day, I just need the extra time to be able to do it.

For reference, I'm 22M, 5'10"", 140lbs. I weight train 3x a week and do cardio 2x a week. On work days it's hard to even hit 2,000 calories, but on my days off I can go up to 4,000 if necessary. I'm eating 150-190g of protein a day and I'm on a vegetarian diet.

5982,"3-4 weeks ago I decided to put on some muscle mass with a high calorie diet and daily workouts. Unfortunately I only have a 20lbs KB, ideally i'd like a 35lbs one but I make it work.

Before I started, you could say I was the ""skinny-fat"" kind at 170-175lbs (5'11). Since then I've reached a high of 185 but usually hover around 183 and i've lost alot of that ""skinny-fat"" look and look more toned. Like I said, ideally i'd like to have a 35lbs KB or heavier and I believe that that would help me put on more muscle mass but I'm happy at the progress so far.

I aim to eat between 3380-3500 calories a day and 1 for 1 grams of protein and get it (mostly) all from healthy foods.

Once I reached 183-185 I maintained that for a couple of days, gradually gaining a little more, however in the past 3 days my eating/training routine has been interrupted by night shifts at work and in that time i've already lost 2lbs. It was kind of discouraging since I don't want to go below 180 again.

5983,"It's really funny how it been more than 6 months now, you can check my transformation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brogress/comments/frljw2/m1859_110lbs_to_150lbs_6_months/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) but my appetite is still like of of a small child. I'm always the one that eats the biggest meals and the most food compared to my friends and family, but that's not because I'm hungry or enjoying it. It's because I'm super determined to get bigger.

Sadly, since I've started this whole bulk thing, I ate more than I could handle, I was always on the verge of throwing up, feeling super sick but I guess that kept well to the point I was no longer even able to eat the same amount, like my body think it's poison.

 It's been super tough lately to gain weight. some days it takes me so long to finish my meals that my meal plan starts to get messy. Instead of having 2 meals in 4 hrs, I get 2 meals in 5-6 hrs because I'm still trying to get 2 hrs break from each meal as a bare minimum. I don't even get hungry that quickly, it takes me 4-5 hours to get hungry enough so I start thinking about food but 4-5 hrs is too much for bulking.

My appetite definitely grew bigger than it originally was because I could survive on one small meal but it's not yet like I'm a full grown adult. I get full super fucking quick and it's really hard reaching my calorie goal everyday. And eating small meals doesn't do it for me since I don't get hungry fast and I'd rather have a big meal fast, before my stomach realize it and makes me feel sick.

 Any tips for me?

Maybe share your favorite bulking foods? Ned ideas might revive my appetite. Maybe the foods that I'm eating are just too low on calories. Thanks a lot!",0

I read [here](https://www.t-nation.com/training/the-best-damn-workout-plan-for-natural-lifters) that too much intensity is actually bad for gains, I haven’t seen significant improvement in the last month that I’ve been home in strength or muscle, so starting Monday I decided on 2 exercises per muscle group per day which drastically cut my workout time, I still get a pump and feel tired after. Is this a good idea or should I change what I’m doing if I’m able to do more, I still feel like I have enough in the tank to do more exercises?",0

Some  days, my weight will stay in the mid and upper 50s. I've even weighed  myself at 164. Other days, I'll stay in between 142 lbs and 149. Some  days are a mix. I'm doing my best to eat three (relatively) hearty meals  a day, usually snacking furiously in between. My only 'ailment' is  Celiac disease; an autoimmune disease that prevents the villi within my  intestine to absorb wheat, rye, or barley - gluten.

5997,"Hello everyone, I’ve been calculating my meals according to my macros and there is a persistent problem. Now with this quarantine situation I (27F) decided to stop bulking, given that I have to stay at home and — though my local box is still programming daily routines for us — my workouts are not the same anymore. I calculated my macros in order to maintain my current weight, which is 55kgs (121 pounds more or less). I want to avoid skinny fat at all costs, and that’s the reason I went for a higher carb/lower fat macro: 156g protein, 46g fats and 260g carbs. 

Here is the thing: There is no possible way for me to reach my protein goal while keeping fats at the 46g max. I just can’t, apparently. If I want to keep fats at 46, my protein and carb intake ends up in deficit. Everything high in protein is also high in fats. What can I do? I’m thinking about supplementing my diet with whey protein powder, but if there’s any solution that allows me to stick to foodie protein it’d be very much appreciated.


Edit: Wow thanks a lot for your answers! I see I may have overthought the macros thing a bit too much. And the protein ratio was off the charts as well. I’m currently having only 97-98g a day, so if I allow myself to raise the fat intake I could easily get to a higher protein quantity (and healthier than 156g, which was a lot). Also thank you to those that gave me a few examples of non-fatty products! It’s always good to know. I’ll keep training and eating the best I can.",0
5999,"Hey guys, sorry if this is the wrong place to ask but I thought I’d give it a go. 

I started lifting regularly this year in uni. It’s been great. I love lifting weights and getting stronger. 

Apparently deadlifts, squats, and tennis do your legs wonders. But, I noticed that my thighs/butt grew pretty quickly and unfortunately that’s been accompanied by a lot of stretch marks and I want to know if I can stop them or if there’s a way to get them to fade?

While I love seeing me grow, It makes me feel a little insecure and worried that if I continue lifting it’ll get worse. Anyone deal with something similar? I’d really appreciate it guys. Thanks",0

I’ve been doing PPL everyday except Saturdays since that first picture (very rarely took extra days off, only when I had to during stuff like Thanksgiving).

Now I don’t really know what to do, don’t know if I plateaued on PPL, or if I need to wing my diet less. Not sure if I should go back to PPL or find a new program once all this ends. I think I’m going to have to educate myself more on cutting and bulking to make my diet more serious.

6003,"Alas, I think the idea of not being able to gym when you were seeing some results on a bulk is getting to my head. I decided to cut so bring down the fat around my waist, but since I've been bulking for close to 8 months now (slowish and cleanish). But I feel im returning to skinny fat territory.

On a bulk : 3000 cal/day - 4 day/week upper/lower split and 1 day boxing (mainly calisthenic routine with rings before joining the gym and incorporating deadlifts and squat)

On this cut: 2300-2400 cal/day  - 3-5 days a week (no set routine) + running once a week

Notes:

\-I started cutting cause I wanted the fat around my waist to be minimal (now it looks larger)

\-I made a lot of gains from squats and deadlifts and weighted pull ups and pushups (none of which I have access to without the gym)

\-I was in my best condition when I was doing calisthenics 6x week and eating around 3000 cals a day

My equipment: a pull-up bar, a bench press with something on the end that allows me to do leg extensions, a barbell (a sort of dinky one that came with the bench) , a curl barbell, and two adjustable dumbbells.

6191,"I'm currently at 145lbs, 5' 10"", 10-12% BF, and muscular after training consistently for 3-4 years. Despite being 145, I am regularly told I look closer to 160-170lbs. I am not sure why I am so light, but I feel it has to do with thin bone circumference:  6 inch wrists, 8 inch ankles, and my waist is currently 27 inches, although my shoulders measure at 47 inches. I also started lifting at about 130lbs and likely around 20% body fat, so I don't think my current progression is too slow since it seems like I've gained somewhere between 20-30lbs of muscle in the past 3-4 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I took an average of Sailrabbit and Lyle Macdonald's calorie calculator formulas to get my maintenance. I got about 1600-1650 for RMR, 1800 calories if I did nothing but sit all day, 1950 calories for a regular day where I perform an average amount of movement, and 2200 calories burned on a day I lift. I also have a FitBit, which agrees with my 1800 and 1950 calorie measurement, since I did spend a whole day sitting and playing games and another day just doing some chores and trying to be a bit more busy and got those ball parks. I'm pretty sure my FitBit is inaccurate on the days I lift because it tells me I burn 3000 calories that day, attributing 1000 calories to my 1.5 hours of lifting.

&amp;#x200B;

Thus, I've been eating between 2200-2300 calories a day when I lift and 2000 calories a day when I don't lift. I'm trying to maintain what I have, especially since I cannot lift with the weights/equipment/machines I typically use. This does not mean my workout isn't hard; I still work 1.5 hours and work generally the same amount of sets at the same level of difficulty, but my limited equipment access means tracking progression and gaining is a bit harder, and I am stronger than the resistance provided by my equipment, so I either have to perform higher reps or get really creative with exercises. I pretty much only have a power tower, a 60lb weighted vest, a wide assortment of resistance bands, and a 10lb, 25lb and 50lbs db.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides eating at maintenance using the above numbers, I have binged once a week for the past month because I still feel hungry eating the above number of calories. My weekly binge is between 5000-7000 calories. Despite eating a large amount of calories, my weight barely budges a lb the next day even though I'm sure the food weighs more than a lb.

&amp;#x200B;

 After a month of doing all this, I've somehow lost 5 pounds. My first concern is I'm losing muscle. I typically start workouts with low rep sets, which is currently impossible with my current weights since they are too light. Even for legs, I have resorted to single leg deadlifts and lunges, but holding/wearing my heaviest weights still allows me to perform 8-10 reps. My workouts are still hard, but my entire routine falls into the hypertrophy rep range as opposed to before where I'd start off my workouts with 5x5s. I also can't track if I'm losing strength and probably won't know until I'm back in the gym. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what I'm worried about it is, why I am losing weight? I did a bulk where I ate 2500-2600 calories a day for 2 months, which resulted in 5 lbs of weight gain at the end, so eating 2200-2300 sounds about right for maintenance after doing the calculations. However, I did binge once a week, so my average daily intake across 30 days is around 2700 calories, which I shouldn't be losing weight from. Yet, somehow I've lost 5 lbs in the past month?",0

I learned more, did body recomp, and exercised at home until **December of 2019**. Then I got a gym membership and started to bulk up from the weight of 70kg. I bulked up until yesterday where my 2 month cut began. I'm currently around 80kg at (almost) 17 years old, 6'2.

6198,"(Sorry for long intro, specific advice wanted is below workout routine)

I am [23M] 5'10 115lbs. Underweight all my life, and have wanted to gain weight for a long time but always struggled to make any progress. 

I'd like to use quarantine as an opportunity to come up with a routine and stick with it - before starting with any weightlifting, I first started with calculating my BMR and TDEE, and am tracking my calories in Myfitnesspal, so far I have exceeded my calorie goal of 2700 every day for a week, which should be enough to gain a pound per week and am gradually improving the distribution of calories throughout the day (my macros are terrible though, but I guess it's a work in progress). 

In terms of equipment, I have two dumbbells and a barbell, but not really enough weight plates to have it all set up at once. As I'm new to weightlifting, my preference is the barbell as it just feels like I have more control when using that. 
My partner and I are both working from home and we have a 1 year old son running about all day, so I need a workout routine that I can be fairly flexible with, doesnt require too much set up, and can be completed in a smallish space. 
I will probably only be able to work out around 3 times a week, maybe 4, so I decided to go for a full body routine.


Full Body Barbell Routine:
3 sets each exercise, same weight for all exercises to save time, reps variable depending on ease of exercise.

Stretch + warm up 

1. Superset:
Wide grip push ups
Narrow grip pushups
(using bar or just on the floor)

2. Superset:
Deadlift 
Shrugs 

3. Barbell rows 

4. Superset:
Squats 
Shoulder press (standing, wide grip) 

5.
Dips (sitting position, using barbell like a bench - my weightplates are very bulky, so the height of the bar isn't too bad)

6. Superset:
Bicep curl 
Wrist curl 

7. Calf raise

Stretch. 

Advice wanted: 

Comments on the routine - is it well balanced, in a good order etc? (I tried to put it in a logical order, with larger muscle groups at the beginning, exercises which give me an opportunity to put the barbell down evenly spaced throughout, and supersets consisting of exercises that require a similar stance so that they are easy to transition between, even if they are a bit odd to pair together)

Advice on reps and sets? I'd like to not have to adjust the weight in the middle of the routine to save time, but that means some exercises are easier than others, should I handle this by increasing reps?

Use of supersets? I chose these to allow for easy transition between exercises, is this a good idea? Would it be better as a circuit?",0

My story:

Hi guys, I iust wanted to share my little fitness and lifestyle journey with all of you.

Like many of you, I was always ""the skinny one"" at 140lbs , it also did not help that I am 6'1 which made me look even lankier.

After getting more and more comments about my weight and my general appearance, I finally started going to the gym.. I just had no idea how and what to eat, so I made really little progress and thought the fitness stuff was not for me after 6 months. 

Fast forward another year or so (right when I started university and lived alone), I decided to get back on track and watch my diet a little more. 
Starting point: https://imgur.com/a/QjeKE

I ate around 3000kcal every day and saw some progress but it was too slow for me, so I went up to 3500kcal which made me more fat than anything (the scale went up but I did not have an honest look at the mirror, I just wanted to add mass). I bulked up to 206lbs way too fast and got fluffy. 
https://imgur.com/a/f9hm1kd

My strenght went up from:
Bench: struggling with bar only - around 180lbs
Deadlift: 88lbs - 290lbs
Squat: bar only - 245lbs
OHP: the bar was too heavy - 130lbs

After 2 years of going to the gym on and off, I wanted to take it a bit more seriously and decided to cut at 2400kcal while doing PPL.
Of course just as I was starting my cut, the gyms closed down.. Sitting at home now doing bodyweight exercices and feeling soft as fuck. Anyway I took pictures today and put them as my ""after"" pictures.

Thanks for reading and hang in there.",0

I've read all the studies, and the increase in acne might be attributed to the increase in DHT. I have been off of it for 6 days and my body acne has cleared, just have to deal with the scars. 

Although I'm happy about the clear skin, I really miss the pump and strength gains creatine gave me. Are there any similar alternatives I could use? I know CEE isn't as effective, but has anyone had luck with it? I'm also thinking about adding Beta-Alanine.

6204,"In the 3 hard set situation the lifter has 2 reps in reserve on the 1st set and maybe 1, maybe 0 (0.5) on the 3rd.

The 5 medium difficulty sets start at 3 reps in reserve and go down to 2 by set 5.

Which do you guys think results in better muscle growth?

My theory is 3 hard sets result in faster progress, mostly due to neural effects at high intensities. But the 5 set scheme results in more reliable muscle growth. 

I've been training for 4 years (but have taken time off so I'm more intermediate than advanced). I'm going to give each one a mesocycle to really see how they perform.

I think Greg Nuckols would advocate 3 hard sets, but on the other hand 5 sets is a lot more volume than 3.",0

6410,Hey guys. I’m almost 4 months into my training end of April will be 4 months. Right now I’m training 3 days a week and 2 days cardio. Doing mostly compound lifts and I’m adding 5lbs to upper body and 10lbs to lower body every week. For some of the exercises I feel my form is going to start suffering. Especially overhead presses and Romanian deadlifts. If I stall on the weight or lower it to work on my form will I be sacrificing muscle growth? The routine says to add weight every week unless you miss reps and I haven’t yet but I can feel it coming the reps are getting so difficult even the first rep at times. How do you go about dealing with this? Change programs or stall on weight or something else?,0

6415,"On the night of December 7th, 2018, I had a realization that I needed to gain some weight. I was 18 years old, 5' 7"", 110 lbs. I've always had a smaller frame, height, &amp; weight when compared to other guys my age. Being an ectomorph does have some positive aspects, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't cause a lot of frustration as well!  I did a little bit of research and decided my goal weight would be 140, which felt impossible sitting at 110, but hey, you have to start somewhere.

The next day I downloaded MyFitnessPal and started tracking my food. Every day since then I've done the same. I remember when I started it told me to eat 2300 calories and I thought that was a lot of food! It's crazy to think how far I've come. Nowadays, I've been eating about 3000/day, sometimes more, but I may go down to the 2500 range in the near future here.

Anyhow, it's been a grind. I really didn't take working out seriously until about 6 months into my food tracking. The first 10 lbs or so came to me super easily, but I was really only doing calisthenics at first. It wasn't until the spring/summer of 2019 that I really started lifting heavy weights. This was around the time where I started to hit some plateaus. First plateau was at about 120, then 125, then 133, then 136. Each time I had to up my calories to what I felt like was a stupid amount, but sure enough, it worked.

Well, here I am today, April 13th, at 140 lbs and probably about 10-12% body fat. I have yet to go on a predetermined cutting phase because my body fat has never got out of control (this may be the one good thing about being an ectomorph), but I officially hit my original goal weight. I look at myself in the mirror now and I think I look pretty good! Way better when compared to how skinny I once was. It's satisfying to see results for something I've been working at for so long.

Even if nobody reads this post, I wanted to ""tell"" somebody because I hardly ever talk about this stuff with my family or friends. I've always been a very self-conscious and private person, but sometimes it feels good to open up, even if it is to strangers. If anybody is interested in chatting about their own fitness journey or mine, lmk! I'd be happy to share what's been most helpful for me.

""If it were easy, everyone would be doing it"" - forgot where I read this, but I always tried telling myself this when I felt down or unmotivated. It is NOT easy, but nothing truly rewarding is! I wish the best of luck to everybody else on their fitness journey!

Edit: I would post pictures of myself but I'm not very comfortable with that, so you'll have to take my word on this one 😂 ",0

**My story**

In July 2019 I finally finished a soul crushing thesis. I was depressed, didn’t exercise much and it showed. In August I moved out of my parents house and started living on my own and at this point all the food I would consume was in my own hands. Between August – November I gained 6 pounds without working out.

Because I worked from home I was sitting a lot and needed exercise and I got the sudden urge to try bodybuilding again. I had tried before but it never lasted. But this time, at 24 years old I was gonna go all-in. I had to fix my posture and focus heavily on back training to fix my imbalances.

Late November I joined the gym.

**Program**

The program I went with was bodybuilding focused. A 4 day split.

Pull – Rest – Push – Rest …. Repeat

*Pull:*

* Pull Up (using assisted machine). 4x10
* Close grip row. 4x8-12
* Unilateral Seated Row. 3x8-12 (each arm)
* Shrugs. 4x12
* Dumbbell bicep curl. 3x8-12
* Dumbbell hammer curl. 3x8-12
* Leg Curl. 5x10
* Hip Thrust. 5x8-12

*Push:*

* Dumbbell bench flat. 4x8-12
* Chest Press. 4x8-12
* Cable Chest Flyes. 3x10
* Standing dumbbell side lateral raises. 4x8-12
* Tricep extension. 3x8-12
* Tricep dip machine. 3x8-12
* Lunges. 5x14
* Calf raise machine. 5x12

On rest days I do abs and cardio and some mobility work.

**Diet**

* Oats
* Yogurt
* Peanutbutter sandwiches
* Protein shakes (oats + protein powder + peanutbutter + banana)
* Chicken
* Fish
* Vegetables
* Fruits
* Rice
* Pasta
* Quark

6419,"I’m a 13 year old, slightly underweight (by 5-7 lbs), skinny kid. I’ve played lacrosse for 4 years and I’ve just recently taken up track along with rowing. This may sound weird, but I don’t think I’ve really gotten into the main stages of puberty yet. My voice is still pretty high, I haven’t hit my final growth spurt yet, and it seems really difficult to gain weight. I’ve struggled off and on since December and I’ve successfully gained ~15 lbs. However, this was at the cost of practically feeling sick after meals. Even though I gained 15 lbs, I look almost exactly the same. I have lean muscles that barely pop from my chest/arms and I was hoping that gaining weight would help those get bigger. 


Seeing as that didn’t work, I think that starting to lift might be a good option to get bigger. My only worry is that starting to lift before the later stages of puberty might not do much. So, is it worth starting now, or should I wait until it’s easier for me to gain weight?",0

when I hold the barbell to almost perform any exercise, I look in the mirror and make sure I am holding it perfectly with good form and symmetry, but here is the thing, I can feel that my left arm isn't carrying as much as my right hand is.

So I close my eyes and adjust the bar in my hands so both hands are lifting equally, when I open my eyes I see that my left hand went away from the plate and I can feel the weight on it.

I don't know what that is, and I don't know if it's normal or if I should adjust both hands symmetrically.

6428,"I am 22M, 72kg/158lbs and 1,80cm/5'10. 

I have been lifting for 4 months (almost 1 month without trainning because of the quarantine).

Right now I am trying to stay at maintance levels and planning to be at a small surplus once my gym opens. 

My long-term goals are building muscle and size in a more ''bearmode'' approach. I believe I have a decent understanding of lifint fundamentals by now, but I really need some clarification. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. starting more as skinny-fat type of guy, I understand I can't just go bearmode straight away because I would just be fat. my plan is to build a good amount of muscle throughout my whole body (probably between 6 months and 1 year) in a small surplus before increasing my calorie intake even more to grow size. is that a fundamentally good plan? 

&amp;#x200B;

2. I don't need abs. of all the muscles, they are the ones I am least interested in. but I also don't want a round belly. a flat belly is my goal in that sense, so my question is: should I still train abs? if so, which parts are more important for a bear-mode look and why? 

&amp;#x200B;

3. my biggest problem right now is that I have a good chunk of belly fat (see photos) and I really hate it. I want to be trainning in a surplus but my fear is to make the problem even worse. knowing that I want to go bearmode in the future, what should I do?

6429,"Hey everyone,

At the end of last year, I decided to make my own home gym. I have full equipment for Squats, Bench Press, Deadlifts, Overhead Press and Barbell Row. I also bought an EZ bar. 

I originally started with Stronglifts 5x5. I did it for 3 months before battling a medical condition in January. I was 65kg and was able to squat 80kg in that timeframe, but didn't see any mass gain. In fact, I was leaner.

I'm feeling much better this time around and I would like to change my routine as I saw that it isn't recommended anymore. I was looking at this subreddit's FAQs and I think GZCLP could be a good step forward as I have almost all the equipment and know the exercises. I would have to replace the lat pull down though.

My goals are both hypertrophy and strength. Would you recommend this routine? Thanks.",0
6431,"Hi!

I think I need some advice on how to gain weight, but doing it can be pretty hard or difficult to maintain as a habit. 

See, the thing is, I’ve been super skinny all my life, so I’ve pretty much endured “comments” from my mom for forever and ever and still do. I just have this vicious cycle/circle going on where  I want to gain weight and eat more and do all these things.m, so I decide to leave the safety of my room to go downstairs and I get a lot of food ready to eat...and then there’s always something my mom or the rest of the family has to bring up or talk about that really just destroys my whole mood and any happiness I had at all. I do really hate all of them, but at least my mom is nice SOMETIMES. As soon as that happens, it all goes away though. Maybe some people get stressed or go through problems and whatever, and they deal with it by binge eating or “stress eating,” but my hunger just goes away.

Sometimes I have that motivation to do more for myself, but I prefer to starve and stay in room than be where everyone else is because they always bring me down or ruin it all anyway.

It just feels like a fight I’m not meant to win because I could never really prevail. My family will always be problematic, and I’ve only started saying that I hate them since fall of 2019. I feel like my post doesn’t make a lot of sense *because* I have such strong feelings about them, but it’s just SO hard to have motivation to do anything with them, the biggest weight in the world, in my life. 

I don’t know if this was the right place for this post. I don’t know if the right place would been the subreddit for gay, or advice, or fitness, or family problems if that exists??? I just know that there’s a gainitMEALS and then there’s this gainit forum alone. 

Sometimes the only motivation I have is when I feel so unhappy about my body too. Sometimes the reason I lose motivation is because my friends want me to be happy with how I am and the “you don’t need to change a thing” philosophy, even though I’m unhealthily thin. Sometimes I convince myself that I’m okay, and sometimes when I just get out the shower and I’m in my towel and my hair isn’t a bird’s nest, I can think something like I actually don’t look awful, actually kinda cute. Ahhhhh it’s so complicated and messy! I want to get bigger because I don’t want to be the way that I am, but I don’t want the driving factor for me to change to also be that I feel I’m terrible and ugly, because if I really installed that in my head, it might be a dark hole to pull myself out of someday.

## Expectations vs. Reality

Two years ago my knowledge of the human body was next to none. As far as I was concerned
the main muscle groups of the body were represented by the biceps, abs and chest. To grow
a strong and aesthetic physique these were, in my eyes, the only important muscles.

As I worked out I discovered musculature I didn't realise existed; ""Wow, what's the muscle
behind my armpit that aches like crazy? Lats, huh? Never heard of them"", ""Hamstrings?  Are
they like a variation on the savoury lunch snack the cheestring?"". As such, over the past
two years I think it would be fair to say that I've learnt a lot about anatomy.

So, two years later where am I? Sat at home with my swole biceps and rippling abs?
Nope, far from it. I've actually found most development in
my lats, anterior deltoids and glutes --- three muscles I'd never heard of two years ago (okay, maybe I'd heard of the glutes before...).

## Suboptimal gains are still gains

Given the two year time span, I think my progress pictures are testament to far from
optimal gains. Having said this, I have still made progress: and any progress is better
than no progress. Regardless, it's worth considering why my gains weren't optimal.

Firstly, I didn't follow a traditional barbell routine. Instead I began by following the
[recommended
routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) touted
over at [/r/bodyweightfitness](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/). I think the
recommended routine is a great routine, however there's no denying that it's easier to
achieve progressive overload with more traditional resistance training. Of course the best
routine is the one you stick to, but if you're only in this for hypertrophy: make your
life a little easier and opt for the barbell. It was simply that the bodyweight approach
appealed to me more, and this appeal helped keep my diet on track.

My biggest obstacle, as it is for many of us, was my diet. When I started I didn't
have scales to measure my weight, scales to weigh my food, or a smartphone to
conveniently track my calories. I gradually acquired these things along the way, and they
made all the difference.

I began by eating as much as I could every day, regardless of calories. This continued
until I hit 140lbs, at which point I decided I was overweight and that I would try eat
closer to maintenance. Of course I was far from overweight, but it still took me a good 6
months of maintenance calories before I realised this (I'm sure this resonates with many of your own experiences). I also went completely off the rails October--December 2019, when I was eating
3k++ calories a day.

Only recently do I feel I've finally got the hang of this eating business. I wish there
were some shortcut or secret tip I could give, but sometimes the only way to learn is through experience.

## Fish are friends, not food (most of the time anyway)

I'm not a vegetarian. I eat meat approximately once a week. However, my remaining meals
are ~50% vegan and ~50% veggie. It is 100% possible to build muscle with such dietary
restrictions, however it will take a little more forethought and planning than just chowing down chicken breasts might.

My saving grace has been daal. For you uneducated heathens,
daal (sometimes dahl) is a lentil dish; it's cheap, it's delicious, it's easy
to cook, it freezes well and it's high in protein. What more could a man
want??? When I'm not eating daal, beans and nuts are my weapons of choice. I've cooked many a bean-chilli in my time---another cheap meal which freezes well.

And on those days I don't wanna cook? I love the supermarket packs of fresh-egg
tortellini. Indulge in some extra cheese and olive oil and you've got a 5 minute
high-calorie high-protein meal.

My carbs usually take the form of basmati rice. I know that white rice is a nutritional black hole, and that a brown rice would be a better choice. But I just love an aromatic basmati. Is that such a crime? When I'm not packing away rice grains, my carbs come in the form of seeded bread or naan bread.

Fruit and veggies are all fair game, so you'll typically find me scranning bananas,
apples, oranges, broccoli and green beans in my off time. Gotta get them vitamins yanno.

## Routine

This is the most boring bit. I don't really intend to delve much into the details here.

I followed the [recommened
routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) from over
at /r/bodyweightfitness. After the first 9months of this routine I got a gym memebership
and so my leg-work was swapped out with back squats and RDLs (eventually to be replaced by
conventional deadlifts). This also gave me the opportunity to work weighted pull-ups and
dips. Once I began to plateau I experimented with a heavy-light periodisation scheme,
which gave me good results.

## Where next

My long-term fitness goals are currently to achieve the [straddle
planche](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pdtwVuuQRlY/maxresdefault.jpg), [front
lever](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e_YwP0O34zM/maxresdefault.jpg) and handstand push-up (no link for this one as I feel the name is rather self-explanatory). The
front lever and planche are certainly better suited to a lower bodyfat%. For my diet to
reflect these goals I'm currently planning a slow-cut followed by a gradual slow-bulk. I
imagine I'll spend most of my future days within a couple hundred calories either side of maintenance.


### Resources

Of course, /r/bodyweightfitness has been instrumental to my progress. Along with this, I can't appreciate enough the content which Daniel Vadnal of [FitnessFAQs](https://www.youtube.com/user/FitnessFAQs) has put out there. For a more seminal reference I've learnt much from Steven Low's [Overcoming Gravity 2](https://stevenlow.org/overcoming-gravity/).

I hated the way I looked, which hasn't changed much but at least I look a little bit jacked now, but more importantly, it was hurting my self esteem badly. I realized how everything was taking a toll on my day to day life. Thats when I decided to do something about it. 

Because I didn't have access to the gym at first, I started out with bodyweight exercises at home. Seeing quick results at the beginning fueled my motivation to keep at it. So its 3 months of home workout plus 6 months of gym. I followed PPL routine in the gym. I didn't really count calories but always tried to eat as much as I could endure and avoided junk food. I have also supplemented with whey protein for about 2 months now. My working weights for compound lifts are B: 143lbs, S: 187lbs, D: 242lbs.

 After the lockdown, I have somewhat lost motivation to workout and eat so its possible my weight may have decreased a bit now. I was merely getting started and gym was helping me get tougher both physically and mentally but, there are bigger concerns now. Its more important to stay safe that it is to stay swole.

So I started this journey like a lot of other people. I have always leaned on the underweight side most of my life. I always put it down having a fast metabolism so I wouldn't try as hard to gain weight due to thinking my own body was against me. Turns out I just didn't eat nearly enough.

7254,"Hi all, 

I’ve recently upped my efforts to try and bulk up. I’m 5”10 and my usual usual weight is around 142 pounds. 

My daily diet looks like this most days:

Breakfast: 3-4 eggs or musli and toast. With blueberries/raspberries or some sort of fruit.

Snack 1: macadamia nuts or rice crackers

Lunch 1: usually a chicken breast, brown rice or 2 sweet potatoes and some green beans.

Lunch 2: another chicken breast and a small portion of rice or potatoes.

Dinner: something healthy, salmon/beef with some carbs and veg.

Protein shake: consists of avocado, almond milk, oats, vegan protein powder and peanut butter.

Gym - usually I go 3/4 times a week but with the current situation I’ve been doing a home workout with body weight exercises and resistant bands. 

Current weight is 151 pounds. I feel much better as I’ve added a bit of bulk around my whole body. But I find rather than adding more and more muscle I’m just adding more fat around my stomach and around my face. 

Should I be cutting down my food or doing more workouts? I feel like if I cut down I’ll lose the weight I’ve gained.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! 

Thanks

Edit: Big thanks for all the advice. I will take the time to read all the comments. Everything is really helpful to expanding my knowledge. My first steps are to work out my TDEE and track my calories using MyFitnessPal. 

For those that are interested here is my starting point with my current diet/home workout. Weighing 150 lbs. https://imgur.com/a/PDwL3Rp

Edit 2: apologies, I have realised looking back now how little information I actually provided. 

I worked out my TDEE is 2583. I calculated my calories for yesterday (which is probably an average day) and it was 3084 

My training regime is as follows: 
When I can go to the gym;
Day 1 (chest and triceps): bench press (5 sets), incline dumbbell press (3 sets), cable fly (3 sets), tricep dips (5 sets), skillcrusher (3 sets), tricep pulldowns (3 sets) 

Day 2 (back and biceps): assisted pull ups (5 sets), lat pull downs (3 sets), dumbbell rows (3 sets), chin ups (5 sets), spider curls (3 sets), bicep curls (3 sets) 

Day 3: (shoulders): shoulder press (5 sets), Arnold press (3 sets), lateral raise (3 sets), dumbbell shrug (3 sets).

Day 4: (legs): squats (5 sets), leg extensions (3 sets), leg curls (3 sets), calf raises (5 sets) 

In terms of weights and reps - I go for as heavy as I can safely do 8-10 reps. 

Current home workout: 
5x sets of push ups (2 sets are pike push ups), squats, chin ups, pull ups and tricep dips. Using the resistance bands: 3 x lateral raise and 3 x shoulder press.",0
7256,"Been training for around 3 years, although in the first 2 I had no idea what I was doing, I did make some beginner gains, in that I went from having no muscle to a small amount. I’m currently 179cm 78kg 17%bf. For the last 7 months I’ve trained 5 days a week pushing to failure in every set and using advice from Athlean X, however I’ve made minuscule gains except for the veins in my arms. My nutrition is also pretty good, with lots of protein and fruit . Any advice as to what I might be doing wrong?",0
7257,"Hi all, before the whole pandemic thing I used to workout 5ish times a week (college student, fluctuated a lot) while running PPL. So I would never do the same muscle group on back to back days.

Now that I'm at home, I still do PPL just a lazier version. For example my pull might just be 6 sets of weighted pull ups and 6 sets of curls whereas my normal pull would be 3-4 sets pull ups, 3 sets BB rows, 3 sets barbell curls, 3 sets lat pulldown, 3 sets DB Hammer curls, 3 sets machine cable curls. Assuming I wanna keep being lazy and don't wanna add volume, is it ok to do pull everyday? Since I'm lazy I plan on doing a full body lazy workout (5 sets per body part) but doing it everyday. Right now my push mainly consists of weighted push ups, pull is weighted pull ups, and legs are pistol squats. Thanks all and keep social distancing!",0
7258,"Pull ups 4x8-10
Dips 4x8-10

I have several dumbbells and over 300lbs in plates, I definitely have enough to stay in shape. 

The only thing is the barbell I have only weighs 15 pounds, when I use it, and put on the same weight I was doing with a 45lb bar it feels much harder/I can’t do the same weight. Is the weight actually harder because I’m now holding more weight on the outside of the bar or am I just getting in my own head?",0
7260,"bit of context, obviously it's much more difficult to get food deliveries at the moment and I have probably lost a few pounds because eating has been more of a struggle this last week.

7567,"Hi everyone,

I'm a 15 year old male cross country runner who specialises in long distance but also does short distance too. I've been working out for around a year, yet I don't have very much muscle gain, especially around the abs. 

Since around July last year to January this year, I've been doing this routine for my abs:  
250 sit ups

250 reverse sit ups

20 woodchoppers

\-12 russian twists, 30 pounds

\-12 v ups

\-12 more weighted sit ups with 30 pounds

\-20 leg lifts

\-1min plank

Finally got around to taking some updated progress photos and I figured I'd share. I've been lifting off and on for roughly 2 years now, but seriously re-started my bulk around September and and committed to lifting 6 days a week.

I work as a trainer and I’m trying to coordinate my clients on how we can improve during this period. First of, many people forget the importance mobility, flexibility and stability training. Huge benefits come from these and because we are obtained and obsessed with weights and gym, we rarely do it and our muscles get stiffed, leading to limited joint movement, leading to an imbalance and eventually an injury. So start doing some exercises that will work on your joints since you have some more time. Second of all, you can do some HIIT work so you can get shredded during this period. Work on your abs, maintain a caloric deficit and shred down. Skinny guys or someone that doesn’t want to lose muscle, stay in caloric surplus, perform static bodyweight movements with a slower eccentric tempo (lowering the movement) and you can also fill up a backpack to get some weight involved. There are many ways on how we can improve our body/health/fitness skills during this period. Stay safe and keep working out.",0

Hi guys, I'm 18 and 178 cm tall. I've been working out for 3 years. Yes, 3 years and it looks like I just got started. I didn't follow a proper diet on the first two years due to the lack of information I had and probably I was eating on my maintainence level. About 6 months ago I noticed that I was progressing so slow compared to other people. I'm not saying that I didn't get better at all, but I think I am still in a newbie phase. I know this is a slow and long journey and I've always thought it. It has never been a problem to me because I enjoy what I do. So I started bulking on January (Left pic) and having a proper diet, together with a consumption of creatine. I got from 68,5 kg to about 72,4 today. Looking to the pics i really can't see any difference except 5 cm more on the belly ( and hairs ahah ). 3 months are not so much but I wanted to check as soon as possible if and what I'm doing wrong.

Routine before quarantine:

Day one (**Push**):

* Incline Bench press 4x8
* Flat Bench press 4x8
* Low-incline Dumbbell Bench press 4x8
* High Cable flies 4x8
* Chest press 4x8
* Pushdown (Triceps) 4x8
* Abs

Day two (**Pull**):

* Pullups 3xuntil failure
* Lat machine 4x8
* Two arm dumbbell row 4x8
* Military press 4x8
* Dumbbell Lateral Raises 4x8
* Dumbbell Shrug 4x8
* Scott Bench 3x8
* Abs

Day three (**Legs**):

* Squats 4x6
* Weighted Lunges 4x8
* Leg extension 4x8
* Leg curl 4x8
* Calf raises
* Abs

\*Sets and reps in squats and bench may depend due to workouts focused on hypertrophy or force.

Diet: 329g carbs, 161g proteins, 80g fat = **2750 kcals**.

At the moment I follow a full-body workout 4 times per week during the quarantine.

P.s: I apologize in advance for my english ahah",0
7929,"Hey all! I recently made a bet with my buddy that i could increase my 1rm bench from 75kg to 100kg by the end of the year, and he said theres no way. 
Just to make sure, is it actually possible to put on 20+kgs in a year? If so, are there any ways to keep a steady progress other than being consistant with diet and lifting? Any special routines? Thanks!!",0
7930,"So just a little bit of context.  Going into the year I was around 140-142 and I cut weight for wrestling and got down to 121.8 at my lowest.  I know this wasn't healthy and I felt like shit while cutting weight but now that wrestling season is over I gained some of it back and now I'm around 129.  During my cut, I lost a good amount of muscle mass and want to put it back on.  I have begun to start bulking and just want some people's opinions on my diet and exercise and things like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Breakfast: 3 eggs, greek yogurt, and a protein bar

Lunch: chicken or turkey, rice or toast, and some fruit (usually an apple) or veggies

Snack 1: Protein Shake (not too calorically dense only around 250 cals)

Dinner: Whatever the family is having but I'll try not to have a lot of it if it is too high in calories

Snack 2: Protein Bar

&amp;#x200B;

For exercising, I have 2 different days and for all of the exercises, I'll do them throughout the day in my house since I'm stuck at home all day now.

A: 100 Push-ups, 50 pull-ups, 50 standing flies, 100 tricep pushups

B: 200 sit-ups, 50 leg raises on a pull-up bar, 100 Split leg squats on each leg

My schedule would be an A day, B day, A day, B day, then a rest day.

Every day I'll either jump rope pretty intensely for 15-20 minutes or run 2 miles.  I'll also go for a walk with my parents on top of that anywhere from 1-3 miles probably.  I also may ride my bike sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

So now for my questions:

Is my diet good for someone my size and age?

Is my workout plan good and if not what changes could I make to it?

Would I be able to have a dessert or a ""cheat meal"" or something like that every so often?  And if so how would it impact my weight?

Should I worry about gaining weight too fast and do you think it may happen?

Also if there is any other general advice I should take please let me know.  Thanks

I grew up playing a lot of video games and I'm fairly sure I developed an anterior pelvic tilt and poor general muscle development as a result of sitting down for so much of my childhood. 

I'm worried about my core being weak compared to the rest of my body. It's very difficult for me to physically get my body into proper form on a lot of bodyweight exercises. Particularly worrying is that during planks my abs stick/hang down from the rest of my body.

I've been working on core for a while through properly engaging my core during compound lifts and some accessories like bicycle crunches, dead bugs, leg lifts, and planks, but I haven't made any progression in my core exercises. I can't do a proper hanging leg lift while my brother who doesn't follow any real routine or workout his core can.

I've been doing some bodyweight work during quarantine and for a lot of core work I've had to start at the beginning of progressions. Core work feels incredibly exhausting, more so than a lot of compound lifts. I can do around 8 pull-ups without core engaged, but only 2 with core engaged. And I feel like its very difficult/exhausting to get my body to physically go into proper form with a lot of these exercises even when I know what the form should be.

So what should I do to correct this? Should I only do core work for the next couple of weeks, and what kind of exercises? Nothing I've done so far seems to work.",0

I haven't really tested my one-rep maxes in a while. If I had to guess my numbers, they would be a little lower than what they were when I was at 205 lbs - 245 lbs bench, 300 lbs squat, 400 lbs deadlift. 

Diet, mindset, workouts, etc.: I stopped eating a shit ton of food a few months after my previous post. A lot of things happened in a short amount of time - graduated college, moved to a new state for work and pretty much left all my friends and family behind, breakups, yadda yadda. My mind definitely wasn't in the right place and my diet/workouts started to reflect that.

I dropped to and floated around 190 lbs for a while, kind of just eating whatever to maintain that weight. I was in this weird purgatory where I wasn't sure if I wanted to stay strong and fat or lose some strength but start to finally look okay with my shirt off. After roughly six months of this, I finally decided to go for a big cut and started the caloric deficit. Total time since I started working out was about 18 months at this point.

The cut was pretty standard - didn't really track calories but they were probably around 2200/day. Lunch was some type of poultry, rice, and veggies. Dinner would typically be a slowcooked curry. Completely eliminated snacking and limited my post-workout shakes to just soy milk and protein powder. Went to bed hungry for the first time in like 2 years. 

I didn't really follow a strict program during the cut - I would do a four day split hitting chest, legs, back, shoulders, and.....cardio? First time doing that in a long time.

I lost 25 lbs over the course of about six months, bringing my weight down to about 165 lbs. About 24 months in at this point.

Now, finally, I've been back on the gain train. From 24 months to now, I've been eating about 2800-3000 calories/day. Before quarantine, I was on Candito's Linear Program again (the same one from the last post) and seeing pretty good results from it. I feel like I've finally reached a good balance between my strength and aesthetic. 

Now, since I've been holed up in the apartment a few weeks, the routine is pushups, body weight squats, calf raises, and whatever else I can get creative with. Today I was doing curls and rows with a five-gallon bucket filled with water...

That about sums it up. Hope ya'll stay healthy and positive with all of this shit going on.",0
8295,"I'll get straight to the point here.

I started bulking at 125 lbs, ate around 3000 calories per day then stalled at 135, I went to 3300 and gained to 140.


I then went to 3500 and went to 145 then stalled again, I'm currently eating around 3300 calories + an estimated 500 calories.

(my mom cooks diner and doesn't want to count it because she thinks it's obsessive).

I weigh everything I eat, except for diner which I just eat a ton to make sure I get atleast 500 calories plus.
I thought at first I might've miscalculated my calories but it's all accurate.

So now I have resorted to fitting in chocolate milk, as well as a 1200 calorie shake to hit my macros.

I am consuming like 100+ grams of sugar per day due to resorting to chocolate milk for calories, as well as eating 150 grams of fat per day. Could this have an impact on weight gain?

Should I just eat more till I gain again?

If anyone has gotten some tips for me please let me know!",0

I like the idea of calisthenics but heard it is not growth focused. Also tried 5x5 before but could increase very quickly, this was probably due to not eating enough though.

8301,"So I decided to start bulking up, eating a calorie surplus. I’m 6’3”, male, 28 years old, currently standing at 170 lbs. I started this journey last December, and over the last 4 months of both exercise and diet I’ve put on 12 lbs, meaning I was 158 lbs when I started. It might not be much, but considering how hard it is for me to gain weight being a skinny dude, I’m proud of my results. I have actually grown muscle and people tell me it really shows and compliment my advances, and it makes me feel great. My goal is to hit the 185 lbs mark.

However, there’s a downside to all this, and it’s that I gained a pot belly. Not huge, but my stomach is definitely not flat anymore. In some pictures I can see it underneath my shirt. I do abs every single day during my workouts and my pack just won’t show because it’s now hidden under a layer of fat that really bothers me.

I’ve read that in order to lose that belly, I need to increase my abs routine’s intensity and do more cardio. Wouldn’t cardio ruin what I’ve achieved so far though?

My diet consists in steak, chicken, tuna, white rice, black beans, eggs, whole wheat bread, and so on. Over the course of the day I eat peanuts and Nature Valley protein bars. After my workouts I drink a shake of Serious Mass, whey protein, oats, peanut butter and a banana. I’m thinking maybe there’s too much sugar in that last one, which might be where the problem lies, but I’m not sure. It was only after I started eating like this that I actually managed to gain some weight; before that all my attempts were futile.

So, I’m asking all the experts here, what should I do to lose this very annoying pot belly while still bulking up? More cardio or change my diet? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",0

Hello,

I had 2 questions!

1. My workout (due to the isolation) involves mainly working on my core. I do an intensive workout for 20-30 mins. Should I be drinking protein at all?
2. I've been noticing dry throat after drinking my protein shake (Ultimate Nutrition). I drink my shake with roughly (6-8oz, 200-250ml) milk and use the bottle itself to shake it. I've been doing this for the past month and never had any such an issue. Am I doing something wrong?

Also, I also have and habit of drinking a lot of water after the shake. Does that have an affect on the effectiveness of protein? I do understand that my workout and diet are more important than the use of supplements. I just wanted to know if it does drinking water immediately after the shake counts as a negative factor.

Thanks!",0
8303,"Hey guys, I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this but I got a quick question about what weightlifting shoes to buy.

So basically I like squating and deadlifting barefoot but recently my gym has asked me to stop for safety reasons. Most weightlifting shoes  I saw and articles I read are saying get shoes with a heel for squating. I also saw some weighting shoes that are designed in a barefoot way which appeal to me, but are suggested not for squatting.

My question is do I get the shoes with the heel which are good for squatting but maybe bad for deadlifting. Or go for the barefoot type shoes which are possibly good for both. Or should I get both ? 

Sorry if this is a stupid question or I'm not clear , thanks",0

Do you think the numbers are off for the food I am eating or I am simply not eating enough? I haven't even gone to the gym in two weeks due to the shut down and expected to gain weight during this time and haven't even done that.

8305,"So I asked on r/fitness if it was ok to do 4 excersises of 4 sets of chest twice a week and someone told me that it was fine if I was not having recovery issues but that if I didnt have them it was most likely that I wasnt training close to failure and he suggest doing 18-20 sets and thats what I dont understand. I understand probably that you dont know to much volume to grow but I do not understand what he said about training close to failure.

My reps go like this when doing 4 excersises 4 sets (example)

12-11-10-8  probably 1-2 reps in the tank. Other excersises go like that to and I up the weight once I do 12-12-12-12 (OBVIOUSLY HERE FIRST ONES ARE PROBABLY NOT 1-2 REPS IN THE TANK, THERE ARE MORE IN THE TANK) and probably start with 11-10-9-8

So isnt it the same while doing for example 3 excersises 3 sets ??? Its gonna be like this:

12-11-9.   1-2 REPS IN THE TANK 
And progress when doing 12-12-12

So according to what I just said Iam training close to failure right? And obviously when you get stronger first sets are gonna be no longer really close to failure.",0

I have a very active lifestyle, but manage to force down around 4,000 calories everyday. I usually eat until full every meal, and eat five times a day. I eat vegetarian, and mostly avoid dairy products. For saturated fats I consume coconut milk (the full fat version), and for protein I eat a ton of peanut butter, seeds, lentils, oats, soy, and more. I don't have any doubts that I am getting all the micro and macro nutrients needed for weight gain.   


But despite what I think is a pretty solid regimen, I have an issue where I am shitting 5 times a day. The stool looks largely undigested and I can usually see bits of roughage from the previous day's meals. The less I eat, the more solid my stool is. So I've wondered if I'm eating so much that my body is constantly trying to clear room for the next meal. But that doesn't really make a lot of sense. My anxiety isn't severe at all, but I definitely notice bowel movements when I get nervous.

I've got a 52.5lb adjustable dumb bell set. I'm to figure how to adapt the program to work with what I have.

I'm basically an obese guy who started gym last week, **my goal is to loose weight and bulk-up/build muscle to have a good appearance**. I'm basically confused on what to do, should I cut all the obese weight to a healthy weight range then bulk up? Or can I bulk up while I'm a fatty with the fat turning into muscle? I've sought advice from many people, their opinion is basically half-half. I'm basically left confused on what to do.

I basically want to **appear decent looking in a year**, not skinny but built up (if possible). But I heard the cutting period takes a lot of time from from 5 months to 7 months, especially with my weight which is 135kg (297 pounds). So there's no room in the same year to build proper muscle (or is it possible?).

Sorry if I'm asking too much. But the reason why I want to achieve everything in a single year is because I want to ask a girl out, who's coming back from abroad next year. And I simply can't loose the competition of getting her. **I'll do anything to be in good shape no matter how extreme it is, and I'll even show results/progress along the way. So help this boy out.**

**Here's some basic information about me:**

* **Weight:** 135kg (297 pounds)
* **Ideal weight according to some BMI calculator:**  56.7kg-76.6kg
* **Height:** 175cm (5'9 feet)
* **Age:** 22 years old

Also since starting gym, I've only been doing cardio and fat burning exercises while on Keto (Ketogenic diet). I thought it would help me cut the weight quicker in the mean time, while trying to formulate a good plan for the year. Every piece of advice will help. From training programs/schedule, diets, nutrition. etc. I'm also a fitness illiterate, so please go easy on me and explain like I'm five.

I guess this is all, and thank you. I wish everyone to stay safe in these dark times.

Ive been lifting for around a year now and when I started I researched for the best program and people praised the push/pull/legs split which I have been doing for almost the entire time. 

  
Thought, last months I been thinking I spend to much time on smaller exercises and I could do better gains and get stronger in general if I would focus on benching squatting and rowing often and more. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I came across this program:  


Monday: Bench 4x, Pull ups 4x, Squats, 4x, Standing rows, 4x, Bicep curls 3x. (more back) 

Tuesday off 

Wednesday: Benchs x4, Squats x4, Incline bench x3, Calfs x3, Tricep variaton x3) (more chest) 

Thursday: Deadlift 5x, RDL x4, Standings rows, lateral raises x4, Bicep curl x3 (deadlift day)

Friday: off

Saturday: Squats x4, Bench x4, Pull ups x3, Bulgarian split squats x3, tricep variaton, x3, calf x3 (more leg day)  
Sunday: off

8705,"Hi, I am trying to recomp. I am looking to get to ~12% bf as my end goal.

For the past month, I have been eating 1500 calories per day with one cheat meal a week. I am eating around 140g of protein a day, and filling out the rest of my calories with as little fat as possible, and the rest with carbs. 
I have also been working out 6/7 days, doing cardio 3 times a week and  training every body part at least 20 sets a week with each set being until failure. 

I began relatively weak, but have been making strength progress so far. For example, 4 weeks ago I was unable to do a single pullup, but now I can do up to 6 at a time. Furthermore all my lifts have increased decently. 

However, after a month of eating high protein at deficit, my weight has not changed at all and I look fairly similar. After a month, i have made no progress on the scale and it is a bit demoralizing as I want to get lower BF. I don’t know what I should continue doing to maximize my progression. 

Is this lack of change of weight due to muscle gains? Does this mean what i’m doing is working and I should continue? 

OR

Should I cut some calories out? Should I do more cardio? Should I eat more or at maintenance instead of at deficit?

9126,"Tip: Your body knows how much weight you lift long term. Here’s an example:

Bicep curls; 50 lbs x 5 reps, 3 sets, every 2nd day. (Per peak week: 2250 lbs)

Bicep curls; 40 lbs x 10 reps, 5 sets, every day then rest for weekend. (Per peak week: 10,000 lbs)

That’s 11,000 lbs vs. 40,000 per month. Or, 132,000 vs. 480,000 lbs annually.

What does this all mean? It means, if you’re not gaining any mass in the area you’ve plateaued, you can’t get a better max rep, nothing is growing in that area and you’re just getting more fat, you need to do more sets per week. Very simple. If you have to lower the weight to do more sets do it. Your body will adapt to the long term weight and grow based on that.

Does that mean you should do 200 sets a month with this new info? Not necessarily. It means incorporate another set to your daily each week and keep increasing. You want to force your body to adapt to more work.

What you don’t want to do is “shock the muscle” by varying your exercises. Science has proven consistent work of muscle groups with additional weight and/or sets will grow your muscles better than variation, which is undoubtedly accurate if you think about it. Hope that helps, it sure did me.",0

I've been seriously going to the gym for about 2.5 months (4-5 days a week). Typically I've done 2 days cardio (30 mins of stairmaster) and 3 days of a 5x5 -type routine. I'm trying to put on muscle and I'm eating around 2.5k calories a day, up from my usual 2k (tracking this all on myfitnesspal).

I've went from about 59kg to 62kg, which is great - my back and chest are noticably bigger but I've put on a bunch of fat around my stomach/sides. I'm trying to avoid putting on more fat.

I eat pretty clean (I thought) - tends to be 121protein, 240carbs, 76fats (my macro average for the last week). I'm pretty sedentary at the moment as I'm applying for grad jobs - so my activity outside of working out is probably low.

9136,"About 2 years ago i had never stepped foot in a gym. I was getting more and more self conscious about my body and weight so i finally decided to try to get in shape.  

**Pics**  

https://imgur.com/c8UNZMR  

**Training**  

When i first started out i had no plan at all, i just went to the gym and did mostly machines, this eventually progressed to a 3 day bro split. I often skipped legs which meant i often hit the gym only 2 times per week. I had some small breaks here and there and no structure with my workout. One day it hit me, what's the point of going to the gym if i will not take it more seriously? So i ended up running PHUL for 5 months, and then currently been running PHAT for 1 month.  

**Diet**  

I have never tracked my calories, i have just tried to eat large protein rich meals. A typical day of eating usually looks like this:  

* Breakfast: Oatmeal with 1 scoop of whey and some milk  
* Lunch: Large protein rich meal, often about 300g of minced beef with rice or pasta  
* Snack: 2 slices of crisp bread with cheese and glass of milk.  
* Dinner: Same as lunch  
* late night: Protein shake with 1-1.5 scoops of whey mixed with milk  

**current lifts**  

Bench: 100kg x 5 reps (220 lbs)  
OHP: 52.5kg x 8 reps (115 lbs)  
Squat: 115kg x 5 reps (253 lbs)  
Incline dumbell press: 30kg dumbells x 10 reps (66 lbs)  

My biggest mistake when i started going to the gym was to not follow a structured program and tracking all my lifts. Once i started taking this seriously i got alot more motivated and enjoyed working out much more. I have been using the Jefit app to track my workouts. Soon i think its time to cut, i'm still not happy with my pecs though...",0

My chest the next day kills but I still haven't seen any gains except on my arms and shoulders (As i've been upping the weight so much on almost every exercise so that I am just able to lift it). 

I have been eating lots of white pasta, rice, white bread, chicken, tuna and beef (Now getting around 150g of protein per day) but my belly has now gotten fatter and my abs have disappeared yet my chest has not gotten any bigger (even despite doing so much upper chest workouts)

My goals are to be lean but have a nice big chest, sixpack and arms. Im afraid if I keep bulking it's just going to continue to go onto my stomach.

I used to have one in the morning, 800 calories, i need 3000 to gain, and it was so hard to eat another 2200, after pasta + beef and rice+salmon I was still left with quite a bit eating sandwiches and granola and whatever to try and reach it, but I always felt so full... 

Yesterday I forgot to make salmon so I said fuck it, I’ll drink another shake instead.

9146,"In my health class, we learned that one of the causes for rising obesity rates is that eating between meals has become more &amp;amp; more common over the years. 

I have a theory that people like us were skinny thru out childhood probably because we never developed that ""snacking habit."" At least, I didn’t ... idk about you guys tho but I’m curious. 

I used to only eat whenever I became *starved* (not simply hungry), which often led to only 2 meals per day. And I would end my meal once I felt *not hungry*, rather than until I was *full*.

Snacking would’ve required me to eat when minorly hungry ... which was  not a thing I naturally did.

When I first started keeping a food log, I was floored at how hard it is to actually eat so many calories. At 2 meals/day, I would theoretically have to eat 1200 cal per meal to reach my cal surplus goal. At the time, that many calories in one meal sounded impossible with my appetite. 

So I thought how the hell do overweight ppl get calorie surpluses so easily? Do they really just eat 1000+ cal meals on the reg?

Maybe. But it’s more likely they just achieve their surplus through the help of snacks, which I had vastly underestimated before.

Did you guys regularly ‘snack’ growing up?",0
9147,"What are your experiences with building a better back with sumo deadlifts vs conventional deadlift? 

I'm currently running a PPL program and I'm tossing up between just alternating between both stances or focusing on one.",0
9148,"I fuckin' hate eating. I was born with a medical condition that ties my overall health to my body weight, and I have not been my ideal weight for my entire life. Nearly every meal was a chore, and while I could hit my calorie needs the occasional day, I would inevitably fall back to lower calorie periods and my weight would reflect that. I have tried everything. I get government prescribed milkshakes, in unlimited amounts, which I've used to supplement. I add butter and oil to all my meals. But it was never enough.

Part of the problem is that, as a result of being forced to eat considerably more than I want to all the time, I sort of hate everything to do with food. Cooking, meal prep, dishes. To get enough to eat it seemed like I had to spend half my free time focused on food! 

Until I discovered the holy food of chia and flax seeds. High in protein, and with complementary forms of fibre (chia contains soluble fibre, which loosens your stool, while flax contains insoluble fibre, which thickens it), as well as a number of other nutritional benefits, they are nearly the ideal food.

There is a trick, however, to using them to their full potential. Chia seeds, and flax to a lesser degree, tend to thicken up milkshakes and turn them more into a pudding (chia pudding). This initially sounds like a deal-breaker, until you implement the following strategy:

Take your intense oil filled milkshake. I use a mix of canola and olive oils, yogurt, milk, peanut butter, banana, whey isolate and a number of supplements (vitamins, some salt, creatine). With a sufficient quantity of cooking oil you can really crank up the calories to an arbitrary strength. And without the seeds, the consistency is about that of half n half cream.

Usually for me, I tend to consume a 450g shake at a time - not too hard to quickly drink a pint of cream, right? - with about 10-15% cooking oil, which typically sticks it around 1000cals in a single pint.

Now, this is the trick - take your mixture of chia and ground up flax seed (I use a 1:1 mix, though your mileage may vary depending on how much of each type of fiber you prefer), and mix it into the shake immediately before you drink it.

Now drink it before the shake thickens up from the seeds.

The seeds will expand in your stomach, once its already consumed, making your gut feel comfortable with the amount of oil consumed, but you won't have to deal with the challenges of consuming the thickness. This expansion quality is what really sets the seed shake apart from the others, as you are basically taking a short-cut around the digestive issues you would have from consuming such a rich shake otherwise. I typically have about 50g 1:1 seed mixture (so 25g each type), in a 400-450g shake.

The particularly amazing part about this strategy, is that with a large lack of complex carbs, I find drinking this shake doesn't impact my level of hunger nearly as much as, e.g., drinking a Boost Plus would. So, I drink one of these, and then Im hungry again an hour later.

Anyway I spoke to my dietitian about this, and she gave me the complete nutritional information for this shake, which I will paste at the end.

Hopefully this is helpful to someone else! Using this strategy I have finally been able to put on weight, and keep it on, and I currently weigh the most I ever have in my life with continued progress expected.

Note that this particular formulation of the shake includes some avocado oil. Further, many of the specs are adjustable: add more seeds for more fibre, more oil for more calories, and more whey for more protein. Complex carbs are filling and thick no matter the source, and so it is light in this respect but you can just eat some chips or something.

Edit - Also note you have to ground up your flax seeds! Otherwise the insoluble fiber shell will prevent all the nutrients on the inside from getting digested (it'll pass right through). You don't need to worry about grinding your chia seeds because the shell is soluble fiber.",0

Now that I finally hit my beginner goal for bench press (135x1) I have some more questions for the [Reddit PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf). 

In the program, it calls for 4 sets of 5 and a set of AMRAP. Should I be doing the same weight for all 5 sets, or should I be slowly going down? For example, should be I be doing 115 for 5 sets of 5 or trying to do 125 for 1 set of 5 and attempting to stay at the same weight but getting less reps? 

Also, for squats, my progress has kind of stalled. Whenever I squat, my lower back rounds out (according to my friend, gonna get a video tomorrow when I do legs) when I get close to parallel. For context, my squatting the last time I went was **45 1x8 95 1x8 155 1x5 185 1x5 1x3 175 1x3 155 1x6** (including warm up). Am I doing this right, or should I be doing something like 170-180 for 3x5 and a fourth set of AMRAP? 

For clarification, my lifts have gone up as follows over the month and a half doing what I described in the post (heavy set and going down each time)

Squat 135 4x5 **to** 185 1x5, 1x3 175 1x3, 155x6
Deadlift (hex bar) 135 1x6 **to** 225 1x8
Bench Press 95 2x5 100 1x3 105 1x3 **to** 135 1x2 130 1x1 115 1x5 1x3 110 1x8
OHP 65 2x5 70 1x5 1x4 **to** 75 2x3 70 1x5 1x6

Sorry that the max sets are all kinda weird. Thanks!",0
9585,"I'm currently wearing a Polar H10 just to see how many calories I actually burn per day.

It is said to be one of the most accurate heart rate monitors out there and I've been told the a HRM is the most accurate commercially accessible way of tracking calorie expenditure. 

I'm 6'1 180lbs. Good amount of muscle.

I'm doing this because I lost way too much muscle on a recent cut so i think I vastly underestimated my TDEE.

I was cutting at 1800 calories. I lost 3kg of muscle mass.

Today I've done this:

**1 hour of cycling - 600 cals. Average HR around 110**

**1 hour half of weightlifting - 750 cals.** 

Average HR was around 130

**So 2 hours of workouts = 1,350 cals.**

Post gym I'm burning about **230 cals an hour j**ust standing around, pacing, sitting etc. **AVG HR 85**

I'm also using the HRM throughout the entire day to see how much I've burnt during sleep / being awake.

I think I will end up around 4750 cals for maintenance for today. 

Is this accurate?",0

I started lifting in September, with the intention to increase my strength and also develop a more aesthetic physique. Through this time I have been following the Ivysaur 4x4/4x8 program. Initially I did all of the excercises using the barbell without any weights. 

For the first two-three months I added weight to the barbell for all excercises weekly in increments of 2.5kg or 5kg, however I eventually reached a plateau where my strength progress slowed. In bench press for example, I’ve been stuck at 35kg for 3 months.


My progress for each exercise (assuming 4x8):

Bench: 2.5kg - 35kg

Squat: 2.5kg - 45kg

Overhead Press: 2.5kg - 15kg

Barbell Rows: 2.5kg - 20kg

Deadlift: 2.5kg - 45kg

My daily goal is to eat 200-500 calories above my maintenence level (which has gone from roughly 2500 to 3000). Recently I haven’t been able to eat anymore than 3200 calories in a day because of time constraints (I’m a very slow eater). 

My diet has been generally consistent across these six months:

-Breakfast: 100g oats and 25-50g of peanut butter

-Snack: 500g of frozen vegetables consisting of carrots, beans, broccoli, cauliflower (recently haven’t had time to eat this every day)

-Lunch: 250g of Pasta 

-Dinner: 300g of Brown Rice with 250g of Chicken Mince, 100g of Salmon or 125g of Sardines

I’ve been going to the gym and trying to gain weight for 6 months now.  Overall I am disappointed and confused about the progress I have made, as it appears to me as minimal.
Compared to the progress that other users have made, I feel as though I’m still relatively weak and can’t lift much weight. 
Additionally it appears as though I don’t physically appear much different (especially in the arms - how can I make changes in this area specifically?)

Am I being impatient? I am curious if I should transfer to another lifting program instead of the Ivysaur program. Maybe I have been following this routine with an incorrect mindset.",0
9591,"Not sure if this is just me, but i find overhead press by far the toughest compound lift to progress.

Why is this?

I lift tiny amounts overhead but it ruins me every time, and my progress on OHP compared to deadlift, bench, squat feels so slow. 

I have pretty scrawny shoulders so of course that plays a part but i also have basically no chest and my bench improves week-on-week.",0
9592,"PROGRESS PICS - BEFORE TRT (6ish months ago) and ON TRT 125-150mg TESTE p/week AFTER(NOW) ----&gt; 165ish to 183 pounds

 [https://imgur.com/a/SPyhmxR](https://imgur.com/a/SPyhmxR) 

&amp;#x200B;

Hello everyone! It has been a long process for me to get where I am now. I havent been consistent through the past 6-7 years but it ever so slowly paid off.

I was stuck at 178 pounds a month ago but have since hit 183 pounds on the scale. It has taken me to eat a lot, more consistently and drink multiple protein shakes throughout the days.

My goal is to hit 200 pounds and see how much I like it at that weight. 200 pounds is going to be either my weight I always want to maintain or drop down several pounds for a year round weight goal.

I want to note that yes I am on TRT. I take Testosterone Enanthate at 125mg per week. So this does give me a slight advantage but truly not much at all given what my testosterone levels are.

My plan is to get to 190 pounds continuing TRT which I hope to reach by 3-4 months time. I have been gaining some fat doing this bulking process. So my body fat is close to 20% or a bit lower if I had to guess. I probably gained a couple % points since starting my bulk.

Once I reach 190 pounds I want to take a lot more testosterone (400-500mg/week) and see if I can hit 200 pounds running that dose for 2-3 months. My hope is I can stave off gaining much more fat because I want to be 15% body fat or less when all is said and done.

As you can see I was an absolute skeleton at the age of 18 due to poor choices with diet and exercise, I had to make a change.

I am currently doing push pull legs split, Hypertrophy and strength, would I look better if I didn’t do strength and did all hypertrophy? Could I add size quicker that way?

So i just wanted to know if people have any recommendations for scales? I have already searched this sub and was surprised this hasn't been asked recently.

I'm happy to pay a good amount, but not crazy, maybe £70ish.

I know you're all gonna shout at me that scales are not a good indicator of fat %, but I'd like one that measures fat %. I don't care if it's accurate on the body fat reading or not, but as long as it's consistent day after day with what its saying, that's fine.

10055,"I've always been very self conscious about my weight. People made jokes about how skinny I am, and they weren't even wrong most of the time. I started going to the gym in September 2018, and this is where I'm now.

https://imgur.com/a/lViujsF

I think I made some solid progress. I can finally go to the pool without getting embarrassed every time a girl looks at me. I have way more energy and don't get tired after 5 minutes of work.

I started with a full body workout 3 times a week that I did up until 4 months ago, when I started joining a friend at the gym. He's helped me a lot by showing me exercises, spotting for me and generally being a great motivator.
I now go to the gym 4-5 times a week, push, pull, legs. 

As for my diet, I've taken 30g of whey a day since I started working out back in 2018. In December 2019 I also started taking a weight gainer (380kcal a shake, I know y'all prefer self made shakes) every evening. Back in January I started taking Creatine. Other than that I just try to eat as much as possible, I don't really track calories.

For the first year or so of working out people would be very surprised when I told them I was hitting the gym 3 time a week which was disheartening. I've finally got to the point where they compliment me on my gains without me even mentioning anything, which feels awesome. 

My posture has also gotten a lot better and I don't suffer from back pain as much anymore, which is a nice bonus.

I still have a long way ahead, but I'm fairly happy with what I've accomplished so far.",0
10056,"Hey all,

I've been lurking this sub for a while now and reached a point where I think I can actually get some worthwhile feedback on my journey so far. It's not much and I'm still skinny but I feel pretty good with the amount of weight I've been able to put on since I started. I've been really skinny my whole life and always just associated it with me being tall (6'2""). I constantly get made fun of for being skinny so, at 26, I decided to finally attempt to bulk up a bit. That was about the end of September of last year so these progress pictures are \~6 months apart (end of Sept'19 to today). My goal is to try and get to 180 by the end of this year although I think that's reaching a bit. But going to try.

**Progress pics**

I don't have pictures of my legs but I've had to buy new pants since none of my pants from before I started working out fit me anymore so guess that's a good sign... 

&amp;#x200B;

**Workouts**

I started with a basic 5x5 since I could barely lift the bar when I started. A few months in, I started doing PPL (which I still do today). I travel every week for work so it's hard for me to get a ton of compound lifting volume in every week as the gyms in my hotels usually only have dumbbells. My routine is pretty much 3 days a week in hotel gyms doing dumbbell work (presses, curls, etc) and my weekends (Friday through Sunday) I get my heavy compound lifts in.

Bench: 75lb -&gt; 125lb

OHP: 45lb -&gt; 80lb

Squat: 95lb -&gt; 180lb

Deadlift: Honestly, I don't deadlift much since I lack the proper form and my back isn't the greatest. It's hard for me to perform deadlifts since I have a pretty long torso and I can't get the form right for the life of me...

**Struggles**

My biggest struggles are pretty much getting enough compound volume in since I can only do one set of PPL per week as I travel for work. My other biggest struggle is plateauing on my bench press. I still can't bench a working weight with a plate on each side yet. I have long arms so maybe that's why it takes a little longer for me to progress but it just sounds like an excuse when I say that. I'm currently benching 125lb as my working weight and my goal is to get to 135 (2 plates) by May 2020. For bench I started out doing 5x5 but now doing 6x5. 

**Conclusion**

I know I'm still skinny and probably still look like a stick compared to the rest of the progress pics here but think I've done pretty well so far considering this is the most weight I've ever gained. Also feel stronger and my posture has improved. Looking for feedback on areas to work on both by progress pics and lift progressions... Gaining a bit of a belly but figured that's inevitable.",0
10057,"Hello all, recently I just started trying to get serious about lifting weights and I found out that my posture is horrible and that I've got prominent APT as well as a curvature of my lumbar spine (scoliosis).   


I've been watching a lot of Athlean-X videos where he suggests posture correction exercises and strengthening the weak muscles (such as glutes, and abs in my case for apt). And I'm simply worried that if I just jump into training that I'm going to do more harm than good to my body because of my inherent muscle imbalances.   


The program I wanted to follow was a 6 day PPL for beginners ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a\_linear\_progression\_based\_ppl\_program\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/)).   


My question is if it is still safe for me to start this program? Or do I need to focus on posture correction and isolation work for the specifically weak muscles? Any input is appreciated!",0

You can clearly see I lost muscle.

But how ? My main theory would be calories too low.

I go to gym 3 times a week, cycle 1 hour a day 5 days a week (as transport)

My maintenance should be around 3K calories a day.

When I didn’t see the weight dropping I dropped the cals way down. Average during the cut was 2000 calories. Sometime 1800 a day.

P- 110-130g
F- 70g 
C - rest 

In hindsight it was just way, way too low. But I read studies saying that there is negligible muscle loss with aggressive cuts?

Maybe that just doesn’t work for me.

Most of my lifts went down.

10061,"I went to the gym for about a year back in 2016. I was just getting the hang of the equipment, exercises and protein shake. I was not bulking at all....this was more of an introductory experiment.

Fast forward to April 2019, I started again...properly (I hope). I was following the 5x5 program as it was recommended a lot online, quite simple, and had the app to use which was super useful.

[This](https://imgur.com/a/IMsdd9F) is about 11 months training + bulking.

I weighed about 50kg and am now around 56. I have struggled to bulk. I am eating about 2500 calories p/day, which along with work, and not being hungry for breakfast, is a struggle to get everything in. I was taking bulk shakes every morning until I got sick of it in December. Recently been eating (and actually hungry for) oats + pb + banana in the morning (and trying to find a new flavour for my morning shake).

Even gym progression has been tough. Most of my lifts haven't increased a lot in months. Maybe the odd 1.25-2.5kg increase.

I'd say I am moderately happy with my progress. Of course, if I had all the time in the world to bulk and not stress about when I have to eat food, I am sure I could eat 2500 I need, easily, and have much better progress. But for now this is fine.

I have gained like 8 pounds or so in the month and I plan to continue bulking until potentially may. I may continue bulking since cutting won’t do much for my current size.

10067,"First, I’d like to clarify that I do workout in the morning. This may not work for you if you don’t because you might not have the appetite if you haven’t worked out. If you work out in the morning, chances are this is going to be nice and easy for you. 

For the morning, I don’t eat until I go to the gym and workout. I take my pwo and then I do my workout. I’ve tried eating before, and I just don’t have the appetite.

After the gym, I eat the following which translates to about ~1100 cal +/- 100 cal. 

1) 18-20 oz protein shake with 2 scoops and water. If you can use milk, even better. Using milk would give you 250-300 cal boost. I just don’t have access to milk after the gym because that’s when I go to class/work. (~240 cal)

2) 1 medium banana. (~110 cal.)

3) 4 maple syrup and brown sugar instant oatmeal packets.  5 is definitely doable as well, but I like to leave room for the banana.(~640 cal) 

4) a big teaspoon of peanut butter mixed in with the oatmeal. I don’t measure this out, but I’d say I use around 1.5 teaspoons/day. (~90 cal)

Putting this all in cronometer gives me the following macros: 

Protein: 68g
Carbs: 153g
Fat: 18g

My favorite thing about this meal is that it doesn’t make you feel full and it doesn’t make you feel exhausted just from eating. The meal goes down super easy compared to something like eggs. 

As an added benefit, it’s also super cheap.

~1.29/2 servings of protein powder
~.50/4 packets of oatmeal
~.30/banana

I’m getting stronger, and I’ve already gained back about half the weight I lost.

&amp;#x200B;

But, in a few days, I’m about to head out of the country for a week. I’ll be spending time in Central America building some houses. I’m looking forward to it, but I‘m also looking for any advice to try to maintain some of the consistency and discipline I’ve built up over the last several weeks. I won’t be able to lift weights while there, drink protein shakes, eat 6x a day, or reliably track calories. I have been told, however, that the food is very good and usually plenty of it, and of course there will be plenty of physical labor building houses. 

&amp;#x200B;

I plan to continue to do push-ups, find somewhere to do some chin-ups, and maybe incorporate some bodyweight leg work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have any advice or experience to share? I have to pack lightly, but are there specific snacks I should try to bring? Creative tips for staying on track with training? Any wisdom for the progressions in the weight room when I get back?

I noticed my stomach area was sticking out more so I measured by body fat %, which turned out to be 23.7%, which is considered overweight. My waist-height ratio is .51 which is in the upper end of the normal range.

I attached a before picture from December 8th and 2 pictures from today here (https://imgur.com/a/lyjIFwA).

As for workouts I’m doing a basic beginner 3x5 program (can’t remember which one) but right now some of my lift numbers for the major compound lifts are 145lb for deadlifts, 135 lb for Squats, and 80 lb for bench press. When I started, I could barely lift the bar. And then doing accessory workouts and an routine from there.

For calories, I have not been tracking that hard, I estimate between 2500-3000 most days and the original TDEE I got put my normal maintenance intake at 2200-2300 per day.

So I’m wondering if based on all of this, how should I proceed? Should I slow my bulk down? As I’m still a beginner, should I proceed to keep bulking even though I may put on more fat? Or should I reduce the effects of the beginner gains by starting a cut after a few more weeks of gaining?",0
10570,"I started going to the gym 3 weeks ago and now I decided to start a meal plan, I started buying more eggs, milk, oats, fruits, pasta, meat, chicken, tuna, etc. And that's basically what I've been eating for the past 5 days, every 4 hours or so.

My breakfast has been the same all these days, 3 eggs with slices of bread, a milkshake and an oatmeal. Then I'll eat something small like a tuna sandwich. A large meal for lunch (rice or pasta with meat or chicken and a salad most of the time). And the rest of the day I'd eat more eggs or some snacks, and eat dinner twice.

The thing is that I've successfully managed to stick to this meal plan since day one, but it's getting harder and harder each day. I'm writting this because this morning I wasn't able to finish my oatmeal, and almost threw up after finishing eating the eggs, I felt like tired of eating it. Now I'm eating lunch and I barely can chew out of disgust of having eaten too much today. 

How do you guys manage to eat a lot of calories without getting tired of it or feeling disgusted?

Recently able to pack on some more pounds. Switched to sets of 8 and gym every single day. This has helped a lot for progress. 

Food: started eating straight peanut butter every day. Other than that not much different from what I was doing. 

Lifts: squat- 160-&gt;285

Bench - 160 ish -&gt;240

OHP- 60 maybe -&gt; 135 

Don’t know deadlift hands are too weak to test. 

Struggles: eating enough. Also I row everyday so that’s ~400 calories burned on top of normal workouts. Hard to get the calories in.

10577,"Hey guys, 

Today marks 1 year since I've started lifting weights. It took me a couple of months to finally change my diet because I thought it wasn't necessary (spoiler: it is). 

I gained 5 kilos in the first 4 months and since then I've only gained two kilos, but my muscle mass has been increasing nonetheless. I went vegan 4 months ago and so I think I've lost some body fat prior to my diet change. 

I've been running a PPL program for this whole year, but I often skip leg day to work on my core (I know, I know). My TDEE is 2300kcal, and I probably eat around an average of 2500kcal every day.  This is the program I tend to follow:

***Routine***

Push = bench press (5 sets 6-10 reps)incline bench press (3 sets 8-12 reps), cable flies (3 sets 8-12 reps), overhead press (5 sets 5-10 reps), lateral raises (3 sets 8-12 reps), triangle push ups, tricep push downs (3 sets 8-12 reps), and dips (3 sets12-20 reps). I usually do about 5 or 6 of these 8 excercises on a given push day. 

Pull = pull ups (3 sets 8-12 reps), deadlift (3 sets 8-12 reps), barbell row (3 sets 6-10 reps), barbell/EZ bicep curl (3 sets 8-12 reps), 

Legs/core (squats, ab roll-out, leg raises, leg press, etc.) This has been pretty inconsistent so it's hard to say my routine here.)

&amp;#x200B;

***Lift Progress (in reps of 8) of one year***

Bench press 40kg(88lb) - 65kg(143lb)

Overhead press 15kg(33lb) to 30kg(66lb)

Squat 40kg(88) - 80kg(176lb)

Deadlift 40kg(88lb) to 100kg(220lb)

Barbell bicep curl 6kg(13lb) - 25kg(55lb)

Pull-ups (5 rep max to 15 rep max)

&amp;#x200B;

Looking back, I'm pretty happy with the progress in my lifts but I often plateau and make sudden jumps every few months. I started with creatine monohydrate two months ago and my lifts went up significantly in a month or so, but I'm plateauing again now. Does anybody have any tips on how to progress better? Maybe follow a more concrete plan? 

I also recently got into grip training (shoutout r/griptraining) and it's been pretty awesome so far. Don't neglect your forearms!

&amp;#x200B;

***Diet***

As I said before, I went fully plant-based three months ago and I've had no issues hitting my daily protein and caloric goals. I find I have even more energy and pleasure in eating, especially because I'm eating a lot healthier now. However, two weeks after I transitioned, I realized I lost two kilos. I was at 68, and now I'm up at 72. I'm guessing it was probably water weight but it was still a bit of a mindfuck when it happened. 

Just like everybody else in this sub, I was skinny my whole life even though I thought I ate a lot. It's a real effort in the beginning to eat at a surplus, but it does get easier. Now-a-days I try to eat as much as possible (while semi-tracking my macros) but I don't overstuff myself to reach my caloric goals. Because I gain weight so slowly, I'm not concerned about having to cut for at least another couple years. 

I strongly reccomend getting [Huel](https://www.huel.com) in order to reach your caloric needs. Three scoops a day is 600kcal, taste isn't amazing but it does the trick and is pretty healthy. Around 20% of my calories for the past year have been from this sweet powder. 

&amp;#x200B;

***Final Remarks***

Just wanna say that this sub has been unbelievably helpful when it comes to getting ripped. Another good sources are Jeremy Either, Jeff Nippard, and Jeff Cavaliere on youtube. 

I'm not yet near my fitness goals but I'm pretty happy with my progress for the past year. I'm going to try to follow a more proper routine going forward, maybe even give full-body workouts a try. 

As always, all feedback is very much appreciated.

Peace!",0

10579,"5’6, 17 years old, 41kg (91 pounds).

Yes, it looks as bad as it sounds - I look like I barely survived a concentration camp, and my image has ruined my mental health, confidence, and ability to stay happy. 

It’s gotten to a point where I wear 3/4 layers just to hide how thin I am - even in the summer. I have not worn a t-shirt in literal years.

However, after getting blood work done (which came back fine, I have no health conditions weirdly for my low weight), I was referred to a dietician.

I was made a meal plan, which gives me around 700 more than my TDEE daily - around 2.2kg a month I will gain if stuck to - which I am determined to.

My question is, while eating, should I lift any sorts of weights/do certain types of exercise? I understand at my point I just need to gain any sort of weight ASAP, but I don’t want to get to a point in 8 months time where it’s very hard for me to gain any muscle.

Or, do I just eat how I am with minimal exercise, and when I get to a healthier weight, start to lift and exercise more frequently?

If this is the wrong place, I’m sorry - I just really need some help as my entire life is going downhill, and has been for years due to my insecurities.

I’ll be here to hopefully post progression pictures :)

EDIT - I just wanted to say thank you so much to everyone that has replied, or DM’d me - I didn’t expect this to gain as much traction as it did, and it only further motivates me to see people giving such great advice, wishing me good luck, and looking forward to progression pictures. It’s pretty much another big form of motivation for me, which I appreciate beyond words. Thank you and good luck to everyone who is trying to gain :)",0
